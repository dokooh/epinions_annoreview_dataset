14144;Recently I had to fly round trip from Phoenix to Los Angeles. I have flown America West before and have had a few delays before but nothing like what I just experienced. No one should ever fly this airline again until they get their act together. On the flight out I checked in at the gate and asked if my luggage could be checked through to my final destination since I had to change airlines in Los Angeles. I was told that I could not. Later I found out I could have but it didn't matter anyway since my luggage didn't arrive in Los Angeles to begin with. The real nightmare began at the gate(s). A few minutes before boarding was to begin they announced a gate change to another concourse. Once at the new gate we were informed of another gate change, than another and then another back to the first concourse. Once there we were told the flight was canceled and that we were to go back to the other concourse again to try and get on another flight. Needless to say tempers were high amongst the passengers and the gate personnel were no help at all. They must be bullet proof to customer aggravation and complaints due to so many canceled flights. Of course the next flight was delayed also by about an hour. With all the gate changes and the canceled flight I was not the only one whose luggage did not arrive in Los Angeles. I put in a claim and they found it even though it took them three days to have it delivered to me. My return flight went a little smoother, we only had two delays but then after boarding we sat in the plane 30 minutes before taking off. When passengers asked about compensation for all the hassles and delays they were told nothing would be done. I have been waiting for five weeks now to be reimbursed for the clothing I had to buy while my luggage was missing. Needless to say, I won't be flying this airline again anytime in the future. The funniest part of the ordeal was when a passenger started passing around a newspaper that had America West ranked last in on time flights around the plane. Everyone got a chuckle out of that.
21578;My most recent experience with America West has left a bad taste in my mouth for this Airline. I know that some delays are sometimes inevitable. However, when it becomes the way that an airline does business, it leaves a lot to be desired. I had four segments to my round trip and 3 of those legs were late. This tells me that 75% of the time this airline is either late or does not fulfill its agreement with it's customers. During my trip, I spoke with several customers and the majority seems to have the same experience and opinion that I have. The airline schedules flights that possibly conflict with their capability of getting to the destinations on time and it would seem that all flights in the western part of the US and the international flights have to land in Phoenix, Az. Why can't this airline have more direct nonstop flights from points of origin to final destination. Additionally, the personnel at some of the ticket counters and at the gates seem to have a bad attitude towards the client. Don't they realize that it is the customer who pays their salaries? I cannot totally condemn all of the personnel as I did encounter two of about ten that were quite friendly and helpful. My biggest beef is with the scheduling and the inability of the airline to stay on time. 3 of the 4 segments of my round trip were delayed. I understand that sometimes this is inevitable. However, with America West, this seems to be the way of doing business. This seems to be true both domestically and internationally.
24523;I was ecstatic when I found round trip from San Jose to Baltimore on America West for $220 to go and visit one of my college friends. It was a great deal and boyfriend and I immediately booked it. Upon arrival at the airport for our red-eye, we found we were already an hour delayed. We had a connection in Las Vegas and I knew it would be tight. The plane arrived, the other passengers deplaned, and they loaded everyone as fast as they could and we were on our way. Since it was a late flight (9:40pm) we were already tired and were annoyed at the delay. We arrived in Las Vegas at 11:30pm, and our connection was 11:39pm. We ran to the waiting gate agent who informed us the doors had just closed for our connecting Baltimore flight. She told us we were being re-routed through Columbus, Ohio and what gate to proceed to. Great, we thought, another stop in the middle of the night is just what we need. I can compliment America West for one thing - upon arrival at our new gate, our arrangements had already been made and we just needed seat assignments. The agent was calm and helpful and gave us seating together in the front, where I prefer. Despite the long line behind us of people who needed to be re-routed, she kept her sense of humor and did not get 'snippy' as some ticketing agents tend to get (we've all experienced it!). Well we had another hour or so to wait for our flight. By now its midnight, and after working all day, boyfriend and I were exhausted. We got on our Columbus flight, which was again delayed a half hour, and at 1:30am, we were on our way. We arrived in Columbus and had a few hours to wait. It was 4am for us, and we were overtired. Now, I normally prefer red-eyes when heading back east. You don't lose a day and normally, you can get a decent night's sleep, if there is no change in travel plans. Since we had an extra stop and were delayed, I was very tired and not happy to be in Columbus, Ohio to wait for our puddle jumper to take us to Baltimore. Finally, we boarded that one (it was actually on time!) and arrived in Baltimore an hour later. We enjoyed our brief vacation and arrived at the Baltimore airport Monday morning for our flight at 10:30am. My friend's husband also had a flight a little earlier, so we just went to the airport with him. Upon arrival, we found out our flight was already 2 hours delayed. Yippee!! 3 hours to spend in an airport. Right then and there, I decided this would be my last cross country flight with this airline. I can understand having delays at the end of the day, when everything has been backed up all day. But this being the first flight out, I was really annoyed to have to wait an extra 2 hours. The pleasant ticket agent already had our connection rebooked in Phoenix and we needed seat assignments. She gave us seats in the front, which I was glad were still available. 2 hours later and everyone boards. It was a larger plane and everything was tight. What the ticket agent didn't tell us was that our seats didn't recline. I don't like that. I think the agent should tell you if you are in front of an exit row (which we were) and that your seat will not recline. I would have sat more towards the back to have a reclining seat. Well, doors shut and there is a mechanical malfunction. Collective groan from all on the passengers the plane, and the flight attendant let in a mechanic. Luckily, it was only a burnt out light bulb, so 20 more minutes and we were on our way. The flight was ok, and to compensate for the delay, they gave out the headsets for free and complimentary beverages (alcoholic) which I thought was adequate. I have been on many delayed flights and very rarely do they hand over those $5 headset rentals for free. Our connection in Phoenix was smooth and we arrived back in San Jose 3 hours after our original arrival time was set for. I will only take America West for short flights, such as Las Vegas or Los Angeles, from here on out. I would rather spend the extra $40 for another airline and not have my travel plans so severely altered. All agents were pleasant and helpful, which does help, but for cross country trips, no more business from me for America West.
24581;My friends call this airline America's Worst. Still, it was the cheapest way to fly from Austin to Phoenix. So, I packed my bags and braced for the worst. Surprisingly enough, it was not too bad. The flight to Phoenix left on time, and arrived on time. The beverage service was good (only served Pepsi products), flight attendants were very friendly. However, the seats left me feeling like a sardine. I had a window seat, which I now know was a mistake. The flight was not all that crowded, there was an empty seat between me and the other person in my row. I still felt like a sardine. There was not much feet space. Try riding in the back seat of a Mitsubishi Eclipse, you will get the same feeling. My flight back to Austin was cancelled due to icy conditions in Austin. Since the person I was visiting made the reservations, they had the number where I was staying and called to let me know. I really appreciated the effort, as I probably would not have bothered to call the airport to check on my flight. They gave me info on the next available flight which was the next day, and instructed me to call the airport the next morning to make sure the flight had not been cancelled. The return flight was overbooked by 10-15 people. I had thought that a NEW flight was scheduled, but evidently, this was not the case. The airline offered a $300 travel voucher good on a future flight to anyone who volunteered to give up their seat. I volunteered. The next flight out was only 3 hours later, and I already would not have been able to make it to work. It was well worth it to me. Apparently, it was worth it to other people as well. I only saw one person who was very unhappy. He was griping about not getting a seat in first class. Apparently, he didn't want to be a sardine. The return flight was actually a little better. The plane was full, but the seats were a tad wider and there was more leg room. It also helped that I got an aisle seat. This flight also left on time and arrived on time. I will fly this airline again. The prices on their flights are very reasonable. The staff was very helpful. I was even pleased with the way they handled my cancelled flight and the over booked flight.
29297;I have seen the low ratings of America West on epinions and I just want to throw in my two cents worth. I have flown this airline 3 times and have yet to receive any really bad service. Everyone seems to want to complain about the airlines, but let's face it they are in the commodity business, which is highly competitive. I have driven 250 miles to fly by this airline, only because the closest airport that they fly out of relative to where I live is Atlanta. Even driving this distance, I was able to save over $200 on my destination. My flights have always arrived on time, my luggage has always been at the baggage claim area in good condition, and I have never been harassed by any of the employees. If some people complain about the customer service staff, I believe that it is due to people wanting to be treated like royalty and pampered. Get a clue folks, you picked this airline because it was cheap, and cheap airlines tend to hire staff that works cheap! You might be surly too if you had to hear the many complaints that whiners make, if you worked long hours for little pay. If you have complaints about the food, well tough! Airline food is not supposed to be good, it never has been good, and it never will be good. Most airlines contract out this function to Dobbs House, so if you have a complaint about the food, tell it to them. If I had my way, I would just do away with food service on most flights anyway, as you generally are not in the air long enough to make much of a difference. Their frequent flyer miles program allowed me to earn enough miles after just two flights to Las Vegas. This is the quickest that I have ever earned free travel on any airlines frequent flyer program. It did have some drawbacks, in that the miles expired with in two years, and that they issued certificates for every 5,000 miles, but they have recently changed that program to where they don't expire and you don't have to wait for certificates in the mail. The seating of the aircraft is no better or worse than any other major carrier, as they are all generally use the same aircraft, so you can bet that they will cram every vacant space with a cramped seat. If I have to ride that big bus in the sky, the airline with the lowest fare generally wins, because once in the air, there really is no difference from the view from my seat.
33313;I have flown America West three times on short trips. I have mixed emotions concerning the airline. America West saved me twenty per cent on the fare. The clerks and flight crew were courteous and acted in a professional manner. The flights kept close to the schedule(no long delays). I feel that some things could be improved. The baggage handlers could take more care. Some of the passengers were rushed in the consumption of there drinks and snacks. Better use of time by the crew could have avoided this. The crew allowed some oversized bags to be carried on by some of the passengers. This caused some delay and inconvenience to some passengers. My biggest complaint is the lack of seating space. A little more room would add more enjoyment to any flight. Over all I would give America West Airlines a B- or C+ rating. I do recommend flying on America West on short trips because of the lower fares. HAPPY TRAVELING!!!-------Chief
40703;"This Thanksgiving, I flew to Phoenix, AZ, their main hub, to visit some family. The cheapest fare was with America West, with a nonstop flight from Austin, TX. Checking-in: ""Leaving Austin"" ; America West had self check-in, that was quick and efficient. Employees were there to assist with any problems. I plugged in my confirmation number, and was done in about 3 minutes. It was fast and easy, and compared to my continental experience, my mom wasn't hit on. ""Leaving Phoenix"" ; This was also a quick experience, and the long lines went fast. There was many self check-in machines, and very easy to operate. Employees were quick to help, and courtesy with a smile. Consistent. Boarding: Leaving Austin, as well as returning, the boarding process happened very quickly. We boarded by window , middle and aisle seats. Employees at the gate were also very kind, and very welcoming. Quick and easy, with no problems. Consistent. Flight Attendants/Service: ""Leaving Austin"" ; The flight Attendants were not very welcoming when we boarded the plane, although quickly attending to first class. Throughout the flight, they served beverages with a smile, and were always checking up throughout coach. They were also very professional. ""Leaving Phoenix"" ; The flight Attendants were o.k. in greeting passengers, once again tending to the first class. The flight Attendants were old, and seemed less tolerant for a refill or an extra napkin. Overall they were professional, and checked on passengers throughout coach. Fairly consistent. Dining/soft drinks, snacks: ""Leaving Austin"" ; The flight Attendants served soft drinks, and gave the passengers the can. Alcohol was also available for purchase. We got 2 bags of pretzels for a snack, which actually was good and had a ""good amount"" of pretzels in each bag. ""Leaving Phoenix"" ; Beverages were served, but this time with no can, and we only got 1 bag of pretzels. Maybe on the first flight they just felt an extra rush, and through the extra bag of pretzels to make it interesting, but it was way different then the dining on the first flight. Inconsistent. Airplanes interior condition: On both flight the planes looked and smelt clean. Also, pillows were on each seat, and blankets were clean. Tray tables were clean, and their was no trash in the compartment in front of me. Although the in-flight magazine was torn, and not available at every seat. Luxury of seats/Comfort: ""Leaving Austin"" ; America West's seats were decent, and comfortable. BUT THEIR WAS NO AIR VENTS TO PUT AIR ON EACH INDIVIDUAL PASSENGER. What is going on with that? The only air that i felt circulating was angeled to the ceiling of the aircraft. Talk about hot, hot, hot. Very hot in beginning, but slowly throughout the flight it began to get cooler. I couldn't of slept even if i was tired. ""Leaving Phoenix"" ; NOT MUCH DIFFERENT! I thought i was either going to have a stroke from heat, or sweat the whole flight. I was hoping, maybe it was just that aircraft, but again no individual air vents. Both flights had 737-300's. Seats were o.k., but felt uncomfortable because of the temperature on the aircraft, and there was decent legroom. Consistent. NOT A GOOD THING! Turbulence/pilot communication: ""Leaving Austin"" ; The pilots were communicating throughout the flight about things in each state as we were passing them. They were funny at times, and made you feel welcome, and cared for. They also warned passengers when it was getting a little bumpy. ""Leaving Phoenix"" ; This flight, the pilots didn't communicate to passengers but to the flight attendants. It goes to show that every pilot is different, but when they communicate, it makes the flight that much better. They put on fasten seat belt sign when bumpy. Inconsistent. Other things: Buying the tickets: On-line purchase is easy and quick. Fares were excellent. Customer Service: Employees were nice and professional and assisted with any needs. Both flights were on-time, and the luggage was not lost or damaged."
45457;"I've probably flown on America West about 10-15 times over the last several years, and those flights were from Las Vegas to Seattle, Phoenix, and Chicago. Now, the primary reason why I flew with America West was because of their low prices. However, I'd much rather fly on United or Alaska Airlines if I have some extra $$$. Why? Well, most airlines tend to overbook their flights a little because they know that they are going to have some &quot;no-shows&quot; at the time of departure. However, it seems as if America West more than overbooks their flights because on several occasions in Las Vegas and in Phoenix that I've seen them struggling to find volunteers to wait for other flights and etc. To go along with that, I can't remember the last time that there wasn't a long line at the ticket counter or the gate for an America West flight. Especially if you plan on departing from Las Vegas on America West.....don't go to the ticket counter, it's usually packed. You'll have a better chance at the gate (and checking in at the gate is a lot better than checking in at the gate with Southwest Airlines). Lastly, when was the last time that you had a flight that went out on time? I admit that quite a few airlines need help in this area, but I have YET to go on an America West flight that was on time. In the end, while America West does have some pretty affordable rates, they do have some serious problems. I guess it all depends on what you can afford."
47056;OK It was so bad I don't even want to write about it in detail. 1. I expect to be boarded when the plan is ready to leave, call me crazy. What I don't expect is to be seated, then fried on a Phoenix runway while big, hairy, sweaty men with their booty cracks showing try to fix replace the radio up front. 2. I expect a modicum of cleanliness. What I don't expect is for the cleaning people to start AFTER I've been siting there, in my seat, for 10 minutes. To make matters worse, you know that blue flushing liquid that they use to sanitize the toilet? Well one lady comes from the front of the plane all the way to the back carrying this big bucket of that blue stuff and sloshing it everywhere. That's just gross. [ok I laughed a little myself here] 3. I expect the appropriate comforts and basic necessities. I don't expect bruises and bladder infections (ok so a little creative embellishment re: the infection part). Apparently only 1 lavatory was functional the entire flight and the line was SO long that they just rammed about 90 pairs of legs trying to get the drink cart through. That's not very nice. So this one #$%$@, let's just say very mean lady, came though with her cart-of-leg-torture and as she was hurriedly slinging these bottles of soda water around, forgot to re-screw the cap, and since it was mostly empty, proceeded to spray the 3 rows ahead of me with a stream of cheap, lukewarm, gassy water. After all that I was still charged a $75 change fee from some guy on the phone who only had to press buttons on his computer for a total of about 90 seconds. Well now that that's over, how was your day?!
47465;"You know, it had to be too good to be true.... It's an old story, really. Girl misses family, girl decides to fly home to see family, girl searches internet for cheap tickets......girl gets screwed! Ok, so I put it a little bluntly, forgive me, but it's true. America West had the cheapest tickets from Detroit Metro to Portland International, and because I'm on a budget I went with the cheapest. All was going well, and vacation was going as planned. Girl was VERY excited! Unfortunately tragedy struck and girl had to cancel vacation. Girl was bummed. Girl calls airline and is told that she has one year from the date of reservation to make new ones. There will also be a $75.00 fee. Girl accepts this and thinks she is lucky. Months pass and girl gets lonesome for home again. Girl calls up America West only to be told that it will cost her an extra 500$ to fly..per person. Girl is upset. Girl logs onto internet and finds a ticket the same price as her original. Girl calls airline again with flight numbers and details of what she sees on her screen. AW Rep tells her &quot;no.&quot; Girl wants to talk to supervisor who also tells her that she is out of luck. Girl finds another company and makes complaint with BBB. Girl is still angry 6 months later..."
47586;"When I lived in Phoenix 5 years ago, I had no problems with travel on America West. Boy, have times changed! I guess my first clue should have been my printed itinerary which said &quot;20% on time&quot;. I thought it was a joke, but I would soon discover that the joke was on me. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, I had to fly from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. America West had the only non-stop flight. My husband had a convention from Monday thru Wednesday, so we decided to go out on Sunday morning to arrive in Las Vegas by 10am. I was excited to have at least one full day together to enjoy the sights. Upon checking into the gate, we were told the flight was delayed for 30 minutes. Then, the voice of doom came over the speaker to say the delay was 2hrs. I am trying to remain calm at this point figuring we would still get in at a decent time and have the afternoon and evening together. After 5 hours of delays and numerous frustrations, the flight was cancelled and borrowing from Pulp Fiction: I was a race car in the red! The staff of America West kept walking off while passengers were in the middle of a sentence and they all seemed to be very oblivious to the frustrations of those on the flight. One gentleman waiting with us said it was the third time he booked this very flight and not once had it ever left Fort Lauderdale. While standing in a very long line to find another flight out, several other people were relaying the same story: Booked this very flight only to have it cancelled after several hours of delays. At long last we were finally crammed onto a flight to Houston but we had to sit apart from one another. Once in Houston we caught a plane to Vegas only to arrive at 7pm in the evening. My whole romantic day with my husband was a bust! But from that point on, the stay at the Venetian Resort(Please read my review) made me completely forget my horror with America West. Being a frequent flyer, I was completely floored by this terrible experience. It was one of the worst I have ever had and I cannot recommend this airline to anyone flying from the East Coast."
48566;"You may pay for a seat, and you may have a window seat, but you do not control it! I just returned from a cross-country trip using this airline. Never again! They offer delayed planes and rude personnel at the gates. Once you're on board, you will be crammed into the closest seats anywhere. You can't even bend over to look in your bags because your head hits the seat in front of you. Once the plane takes off, these cool little TV screens pop down from the overheads and you get to view the safety message on the screen instead of in person. Then the TVs show neat little calming sceens... and then they hit you for the bucks. $5 for rental of the headsets to listen to the movie. My husband and I were hoping to catch up on some sleep since it was a nightime flight, but the TVs came on and the cabin lit up. Sleep was impossible. The flight attendants reminded the coach passengers repeatedly that the bathrooms in first class are for those passengers only and the rest are to use the ones in back, how special. We weren't given anything to eat or drink, even though we were flying from Las Vegas to Atlanta. On the flight home, the flight attendant Carrie rudely told me to close my window shade because my window was causing a glare on the TV screen of the woman across the aisle from me. I slammed it shut and began fuming at the rudeness, like her glare is my problem. I got so angry I slammed the shade back up and went back to watching the clouds, my enjoyment on flights. It also helps me battle the nausea that comes with bumpy rides, which America West invented. But nope, my window is not my own apparently. I was again told to lower it. We went through this 3 times as I kept raising it and kept getting told to lower it. I was so angry that as I left the plane and Carrie told me thank you and fly again, I snorted laughter in her face and said ""never again."" It left me so angry I found myself hunting down the woman who was watching the movie so I could slap her around. I am not a violent person at all, but this airline aggravated me to the point of wanting to do physical harm to another passenger! I unfortunately had another flight to catch, and it was America West. This one was from Phoenix to Portland Oregon. This time the male flight attendant looked right at me, and handed double the nuts to the girl in front and walked right past me. He did this with the drinks as well. I was completely ignored and treated as if I was invisible. Cheap tickets, you bet. Good service, not at all. Fair service, not at all. The crappiest low down scruddy service you can scrape off the bottom of the sewer well, you bet!"
60525;"Only fly America Worst if you really don't care when you will arrive at your destination. My wife got a very good price on tickets from San Francisco to Detroit for a wedding -- $215 each. Shortly after we booked the tickets, America Worst changed the flight schedule for our flights, resulting in a delayed arrival. OK, that happens sometimes. The flights to Detroit were uneventful, but the return was nightmare. When we arrived at the airport on Sunday, we learned (from other passengers in the long line waiting for only a few desk clerks to help us) that our flight had been cancelled. The weather was perfect, and no one could or would explain why the flight had been cancelled. The couple next to us at the desk was also going to San Francisco, and we overheard them being placed on a Delta flight that arrived 2 hours after the America Worst flight. Luckily for us, we were aware of an American Airlines flight that arrived 45 minutes BEFORE the America Worst flight (due to a more direct route and shorter layover). We suggested this flight, and the America Worst representatives looked somewhere between reluctant, unhelpful and confused. They had already been utterly unhelpful and rude, and they showed absolutely no sense of urgency in trying to put us on another flight. When we asked if they had checked into the availability of this American Airlines flight, one clerk said &quot;No, I didn't check that&quot; in a tone that revealed she thought were somehow stupid for suggesting an alternative that got us to San Francisco almost 3 hours before the flight they were suggesting for us. This attitude was only compounded by an evident incompetence -- the clerk helping us constantly just stood at her computer looking at the other representatives, as if she had no clue what to do. They eventually filled out vouchers for us for the American flight, but even those were filled out wrong -- resulting in another delay for us at the American gate. Furthermore, last week I had a friend visit me in San Francisco. On the way here (from Atlanta), his flight was delayed over an hour -- with no explanation from America Worst. On his return trip, his flight was again delayed for over an hour -- with no explanation -- resulting in him being rerouted to another airline to get home. I will only fly America Worst on two conditions: (1) the flight is substantially less expensive than a competitor's AND (2) I don't really care if I arrive at my destination within 6 hours of the scheduled arrival time. That's not often, if ever."
66836;"*This is an update to my original review titled, We Had A Hostage Situation Thanks To America West, dated Wed., August 9.* Let me give a little background in case you haven't had the chance to read my first review...My parents' 30th wedding anniversary trip was pretty much a nightmare thanks to America West. Our flights out to Las Vegas were fine but the return was horrible. We had a delay of approximately 7 hours... After many phone attempts and a few more e-mails we finally received a packet in the mail from America West. (Obviously they didn't really want to talk to me personally since the phone lines were always congested with other callers.) So we get the packet and open it up. Inside are vouchers for each of the 7 people in my party for $150 off our next flight anywhere America West flies. Yippee! I talked to the rest of my family and they are still severely disappointed with the airline. After sitting in the airport for more than 7 hours they aren't willing to accept any gifts which require that they utilize the airline again. My family wants their money back, or at least a partial credit, and they want it now. My husband and I aren't exactly sure what we think about the vouchers since we tend to fly more often. We are not loyal to any particular airline so therefore we're not likely to use America West again anyway. I strongly feel like we've been let down. There was no letter of apology from the company and no apologies from any associates at the airport or on the phone. I mentioned before that we were given AirChecks for various amounts off flights depending on their cost. After looking at the newest vouchers we received we noticed that the two can't be used together. I guess it doesn't really matter since we won't be flying with America West again. It just perturbs me to no end that they aren't worried about how their customers feel. If anyone is interested in flying with America West I have 2 AirChecks that you can have. They state: Based on the future ticket purchase, you will receive one of the following discounts; $100 off a roundtrip ticket of $399 or more, $75 off a roundtrip ticket of $299 - $398, $50 off a roundtrip ticket of $199 - $298, or $25 off a roundtrip ticket of $98 - $198. There are no names or other distinguishing marks on these so they're your's for free if you dare to fly with America West. They say they expire 1 year from date of issue but nobody bothered to date them so they're blank. Of course there is a digital number code at the bottom so I'm assuming there's a tracking device of some sort through that, not sure. E-mail me or leave a comment here and I'll mail them to you."
66852;In writing this review I'm troubled as to where the beginning is. Let me start with a little background...I'm 1 of 3 kids, the oldest, and to help my parents celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary I made arrangements for the 3 of us to fly everyone out to Las Vegas for a weekend of fun. Our chosen airline was America West simply because my husband and I had used them previously without any major problems. There was a time about 2 years that we were at the recieving end of a rude flight attendant but America West padded that situation with flight coupons for our next flight. The flights to Vegas were fine, no complaints. The return flight(s) were absolutely unacceptable. We scheduled to depart from the Vegas airport at 3:23 p.m., therefore we arrived by 2 p.m. to check in. Around 3 p.m. an announcement was made stating that the plane was being repaired and we should expect a 1 to 1 1/2 hour delay. Ok, that happens, we can handle it. Approximately 45 minutes later they told us we could go ahead and board. I couldn't believe how HOT it was on the aircraft! We were told that since they had been working on it that the air conditioning hadn't had enough time to cool it off yet but it would be fine after a few minutes. Once on the plane, seated and buckled we received another announcement that the repairs were almost finished, another 5 to 10 minutes, and then we would be on our way. After all this time we had been seated for about 30 minutes total and we got yet another announcement stating that our connecting flight in Phoenix would be missed and we need to get off the plane. Wonderful! By this time all 7 of us are dripping with sweat and getting irritated little by little. We were led to a small meeting room where we were to be re-accommodated. Again, wonderful! By this time we have been standing in line (a line that wasn't moving mind you) for another 30 minutes when they decided to split the line in half. Evidentially during our stand in line the remaining passengers on the plane had been asked to get off also...the flight cancelled. We were split in half according to our last names and sent all the way back downstairs to the regular ticketing counter. Finally, by about 6 p.m. I had my 5 minutes of glory with the ticketing agent. Keeping in mind that I work in customer service I tried my best to be calm and relaxed about the whole situation, obviously the ticketing agent had already had his share of complainers and he wasn't about to let me think I could say anything he hadn't already heard. A few clicks of the keyboard here and there, a tired smile and barely audible apology I was advised that the next available flight would be leaving at 12:56 a.m.. WHAT? You want me to sit in this airport for 7 more hours? Yep. Ok, fine, do you have any phone cards available so that I can contact my in-laws (who were babysitting my kids) and my employer? He said, no, we don't have any cards left. Wonderful. To wrap this experience up in a nutshell I must say that I'm deeply disappointed in America West. We were given meal vouchers valued at $8.50 to use at any establishment in the airport and a coupon for $100 off our next flight valued at $399 or more. Huh? You honestly think I'm going to fly America West again? And one more thing...where in the world am I going to go that's going to cost me $399 or more? I have 5 kids for heaven's sake! We have since written a letter to America West as well as tried to make a couple phone calls to the customer service department. The hold time on the phone was going to be 1 hour according the automated attendant. Forget that! Once I hear back from them in writing I will let you all know what the outcome is. As for right now, I will not book another flight with America West.
68992;America West is fortunate to have Continental as a codeshare partner. It helps them provide great service on some flights. It also improves their overall flight on-time performance. It has been my experience that America West is late leaving and late getting to the destination. This is unfortunate because they serve a lot of cities in the Western States and could really be a top performing airline. They have never left me stranded though. The service at the gates and on the flights is adequate but by no means is it exceptional. This is one area where a good lesson from Continental will really improve the image of America West Airlines. The in-flight service has never left me upset with the airline or anything, it is just not as upbeat as it should be when they want repeat business. America West is a good airline for those who want lower fares and a bit less service. They model their service somewhere between what you expect from Southwest and a regular full service airline. The do eventually get you to your destination and without a scratch. America West flies older aircraft that are not as pretty but they do fly. The crews are not rude or anything, they just do not go out of their way to be extra friendly. Overall the airline is adequate. I choose to fly Continental when possible, but will take an America West flight if needed since I do earn OnePass miles.
72859;"While planning the vacation that my husband and I recently returned from, I went through Travelscape.com. Travelscape brings up airfares for all airlines on the dates you are requesting, and lists prices for comparison. I am not a happy flyer. I hate to fly, it scares me to no end. When I have to fly, I try to choose(yes, this is going to sound horrid)an airline that I don't recall seeing headlined on the evening news in the recent past. As I was planning my trip, America West airlines came up as one of the least expensive for the flights I needed (and I hadn't recalled hearing of any recent tragedies). As our flight departed the Anchorage airport for the 5 1/2 hour flight to Phoenix, the first words we heard from the pilot were, &quot;There was one pillow for every passenger on board. If you are missing a pillow, slug the person in the seat next to you and take your pillow back!&quot; Okay, the pilot had a sense of humor...but was that good?? During our departure and return flights, over-all, our experiences with America West were decent. I can't say great, but they were decent because we got to our final destinations alive, so that has to count for something! We had one lay-over each on our departing and our return flights. We did not leave as scheduled for any of the flights! We left the runway at least 30 minutes, and up to 45 minutes, behind schedule each and every time. Our first lay-over was supposed to be a 45 minute lay-over in Phoenix, Arizona. We ended up with three minutes to get to our next flight. They were already calling the final boarding call as we ran to the gate. As we entered the boarding gate, we asked the attendant if our luggage was going to make it from the plane we just departed. I told my husband that her grin with the &quot;Of course it will..&quot; response was just tooooo big. We ended up spending the first four hours of our vacation in the Las Vegas airport, hoping our luggage had made it on to one of the next flights in. As compensation for the delay with our luggage, we were offered breakfast at any restaurant in the Las Vegas airport. Okay, so, breakfast up to $6 per person. To me, this was kind of *crappy*. Here we are on vacation, having to spend our first day stuck in an airport, waiting for our luggage, because our airplane didn't leave on time and the airline is offering a PARTIAL free breakfast. If anyone has ever eaten at an airport restaurant for less than $6, please, tell me how you did it! American West's generosity ended up covering half of our meal. At every lay-over, we overheard attendants discussing how overbooked flights were. This probably wouldn't have been a bad thing, if every seat on the plane hadn't been full and there had been more than 6 inches of leg room. The lack of leg room was not a problem for my short legs, but my husbands 6'3&quot; legs, well...he said his knees didn't exactly taste very well. Would I recommend America West airlines to anyone? Yes, if you are looking for an inexpensive airline, with so-so customer service. But I would absolutely not recommend them if you are looking to arrive where you want/need to be on time. I guess I shouldn't complain too much...at least we didn't crash&lt;g&gt;"
73323;I recently flew America West to Las Vegas and had a pleasant flying experience. My flights were all on time with the exception of one leg due to unruly passengers who would not sit down. I found the service and professionalism of America West's employees to be top-notch. From the gate agents to the flight attendants, everybody was courteous and friendly. The pilots kept the passengers well-informed during the flight and even explained that we would be taking a longer flight path in order to avoid thunderstorms. I choose America West Airlines because of their low fares. The only other airline with lower fares to Vegas I found was National Airlines. However, I felt more comfortable flying on America West. My only criticism of the airline is about the cramped seats. Like most airlines, there was not much leg room and I felt like the passengers next to me were sitting on top of me. Plane food was good, although nothing exceptional. If you are a health food person, they served a salad with every meal, but don't expect the main course to be anywhere near healthy.
74940;"Background I had a 10 day vacation flying out of DC National on December 29, 2000 and spending 3 days in Phoenix, before flying on January 1 to San Diego and then returning on December 6. I used frequent flier miles to get a open jaw trip from DCA-&gt;PHX and from SAN-&gt;DCA. However, since dropping off a rental car at a city different from the one you rented it is VERY expensive I decided to fly between Phoenix and San Diego. Since Southwest only lets you change a ticket if you are a full fare refundable ticket I decided to fly America West since I wasn't sure what time I was going to leave (like most major airlines America West allows you to standby for earlier or later flights the day of travel for no additional charge). Check In As a OnePass Elite member I can use the First Class/Elite line... thank-god since the other lines were very long. I got through check-in in 5 minutes and proceeded to the gate, where I was the second stand-by passenger to be called. Flight The flight was operated with a Airbus 320 and the interior was showing its age (looked to be 10 years old). Almost every seat was full and I was seated in the middle, but it was acceptable because of the short length of th flight. Since this is short flight they offer you a abbreviated selection of beverages (Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Slice, Coffee, Tea, OJ) but interestingly use the beverage cart (other airlines often don't use the cart on short flights with abbreviated beverage service. Our flight arrived on time in San Diego. Baggage Claim I was seated toward the rear of the plane so by the time I reached the baggage carousel it was a zoo. Since it was New Years Day almost everybody was a leisure traveler with checked baggage and their must have been 150 on board. Then the luggage started coming off about 20 minutes after we arrived, but only 15 bags and then stopped. Five minutes later another 15 bags came off, but again it stopped. This went on for 40 minutes before my bags came (since I have priority tags thats pretty bad). As I left, some people were STILL waiting for their bags. I realize finding staff to work on New Years Day is difficult, but it seems a real skeleton crew was at work that day delaying many passengers. Overall As a OnePass Elite member, I got credit and even bonus miles for the flight as well as skipping the check-in line. However, the poor performance of America West on baggage handling, will force me to think before taking another America West Flight."
76785;"In the last year, I have had two occasions to fly America West Airlines, both of which were booked by someone other than myself. Both trips originated in Detroit with a final destination in the Bay Area (CA). The first outbound flight took off late, but only slightly. However, upon our arrival in Phoenix, where I was to change planes, we walked to the other concourse (a long trip) to find that the flight was delay, nominally by an hour. That one hour expanded into 90 minutes, and then we were told that the plane we were to board wasn't coming in at all, but that there was another plane landing in 20 minutes that would take us, back in the first concourse. So, all the passengers pick up and move back. When we arrived there, the flight was just coming in, but it was struck by lightning on the way down (admittedly not the airline's fault), so we had to wait for it to get clearance to take off again. After an hour, they had finally begun repairs, and after ANOTHER hour, the plane was judged unfit to fly. Fortunately, there was a plane in the hangar which could take off, but it was in need of a crew (the previous crew -- from the second flight -- had timed out). Another hour of waiting (and another terminal change) and the flight finally took off, arriving into San Jose over 5 hours late. The lateness of the arrival not only meant that I missed a luncheon meeting that I was to have, but I also missed most of the dinner meeting that night. I was not looking forward to the return flight to Detroit, although it was less of a nightmare. My connection in Phoenix was only an hour and a half late that time. A month later, I again had an opportunity to travel to the west coast, and again America West was chosen. My arriving flight was over an hour late into San Jose (problems in Phoenix again). My return flight left San Jose over an hour late, and we all had to scramble across the Las Vegas airport to our connections. I need not have hurried, as that flight was running over an hour late. In fact, it ended up 2 hours late (lack of crew), which meant getting in at about 5 am in the morning (not a pleasant drive back at that hour). All of the delays were annoying, but it was also not fair to the ground crews at the various airports, as they did not seem to be kept apprised of the status of the flight. I felt sorry for them having to say &quot;I don't know&quot; for so long, especially with an increasingly irate group of customers. The airline did supply food at one point (and a case of soda at another), but many of the passengers had already purchased food by the time that happened. I now have almost enough frequent flyer miles for a free trip, but it's one I'm very unlikely to take."
83061;"I hate to speak poorly about an entire airline but this one takes the cake. My whole team went on business trip's to different parts of the country. My assistant went ahead of me to Arizona to set up everything and was due back two days before I was to leave. Our travel coordinator had booked us on the airline and even though it was not one I flew frequently because I generally prefer a different carrier, I thought we should give it a try. Well I should have seen it coming when she calls me from Tuscon telling me that they had lost her luggage on the thirty minute flight from Tempe to Tucson. Secondly...the plane they were supposed to take from Tucson had mechanical problems and they might not be able to leave until the following morning. Which it turned out that she did not leave until almost 9:30 am the following morning. She found out a day later that her luggage had been sent to Tulsa. Now I was really apprehensive and it may have been some type of self fulfilling prophecy, because I also had a bad experience the day after she got back. I got on the plane and it did not smell very clean, the seats were kind of ragged and there appeared to be trash in many of the seats. All I was doing was sitting down when I called for a flight attendant to ask if they could hang my suit coat up in the closet that they have. The attendant looked at me like I was bothering him greatly and told me it was for flight personnel only. I asked him to please reconsider since my coat would arrive creased and not in very presentable shape when he told me absoloutely not and to quit harrassing him. I sat down kind of angry but shrugged it off and waited for the plane to take off. Not long after, a woman came on board and had a huge fur coat with. She also was riding in business class when she motioned for the attendant to come over to her. I could see them talking when the same attendant who told me they would not hang my coat up grabbed the lady's fur coat and took it to the back of the plane and hung it up in the closet that was for airline personnel only! Now I was mad! I motioned for the attendant to come over and although I did elevate my voice, I kindly asked him to please hang my suit coat up. He told me that there was no way in hell he would hang my coat up and to quit bothering him or he would get the captain. But...You just hung up that ladys coat I told him and he told me to mind my own damn business. Now I was steaming so I told him to go right ahead and get the captain because he had been nothing more than a rude, condescending, total jerk since the moment I walked in and it was time for him to apologize to me for being an ***hole. By this time a couple of the other attendants were standing close by and all of them merely stood watching as this whole exchange went on. The attendant then went to the front and I thought ""Finally, there would be someone to tell about this jerk. The captain walks back to my seat and tells me that if I ever threaten his employee with violence again in any way or even look at him cross they will have me evicted from the plane and not refund my ticket. I was flabberghasted and asked him what did he think that I said? He told me that the attendant told him I had threatened to kick his butt if he did not hang my coat up. I told the captain that he was lying and asked him to talk to the other attendants to verify. When he did he came back and told me it would be a good idea if I shut up and sat there quietly because if there was anymore disturbances form me that they would kick me off the plane and leave me to find my own way home. So I sat there quietly with my coat in my lap the entire 2 hour flight. My luggage arrived, and we were only 15 min late but it was enough of a bad experience that I swore to never fly their airline again. I hope anyone who reads this will not use them either. My assistant and I had a very bad experience with this airline on the same flight 10 days apart. Maybe it is a one time thing, but from what I have heard from others it is more often the rule rather than the exception."
88543;I found epinions shortly after I booked a trip on America West airlines. Too bad I didn't find epinions slightly earlier, because the general negative view of the airline mirrored my experience. I have flown five flight segments over the last 3 years, and either 3 or 4 have had significant delays. One was due to lack of gate space, one due to overbooking (earlier flight cancellation), and one due to a drip in the first class cabin. (I can't recall details on the 4th possible delay). I just read an article indicating America West keeps about 2/3 of their flights on time, significantly lower than other major airlines. This is without having a hub out of any of the really bad airports. Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Columbus don't strike me as high traffic hubs. Amenities and ambiance are lacking here too. My airplane diet was peanuts and soda. They also have the gall to charge $5 to rent headphones to listen to in-flight music or to watch the movie. I'd say have fun like Tom Servo and Crow from MST3K and fill in your own lines to the movies. Employee service was generally fine. I'm sure this was aided by being very cool, calm, and collected on my part. Besides, I don't think the employees I dealt with had anything to do with my problems. Finally, there are two good ways to get low fares on this airline. The web site offers some very good fares, like my $200 round trip from New York to Las Vegas. Second, if you build in enough travel flexibility and get flights like I did, you can take voluntary bumping and get your current flight for free, or get a flight voucher. Of course, the free flight may have the same quality issues discussed previously. I hope my wife understands when she flies this free flight that she may run into some delays.
88865;"After moving to Phoenix about seven years ago I have used America West Airlines (AWA) almost exclusively. Initially, I flew AWA because from the Phoenix market, they're about the only airline who can get you where you need to go non-stop. My first experiences with them back in the late 1990s were not good. There were a lot of delays and surly agents. However, things have markedly improved over the past five years. I use AWA because their prices are almost always the lowest. Their website is user-friendly and easy to navigate, and although I occasionally have some technical difficulties, those seem to be much less frequent. You can check-in and print your boarding pass online. Their inflight meals are palatable and fairly inexpensive. AWA also has a very good frequent flyer program with a lot of partners. And the partners are companies you would actually use on a regular basis (like newspaper subscriptions and restaurant dining). If you fly only occasionally but use some of the partnering services, you can earn tickets very quickly. If you're flexible and plan early, you can usually get a round-trip ticket for only 25,000 miles. The only things I really don't like about AWA are the change fees if you can't use a ticket ($100/ticket, even if the passenger can't fly because of a medical emergency) and the fact that the check-in lines aren't always running smoothly. If you do have a boarding pass from the Web, at some locations (their Phoenix hub included) you still have to wait in a line, and it's the same line that people with travel ""problems"" wait in. Their automatic check in works fairly smoothly. Even those things that I think could be improved on are equivalent to the service you get from other airlines. Six years ago I would have given AWA one star. Today I can give them four. If you haven't flown AWA for awhile, give it another chance. You may be surprised at how they have turned things around!"
89187;It may be unavoidable to transfer flights in Phoenix, since this is the America West main hub, however, PLEASE try. I have used this airline 4 times now, and every time I stopped in Phoenix my flight was either delayed or cancelled.Two flights were delayed once the plane had left the gate and stood on the runway. We were stuck for over 2 hours on the runway on a flight that was to go from Phoenix to Baltimore...long enough as it is.And I happened to be travelling alone with my 18-month-old daughter.To make matters worse, she needed a diaper change,and the flight attendant refused to let me get up to change her. She told me the passengers were not allowed to get out of their seats (i.e. be unbuckled) once the plane left the gate! I was not happy. Our plane was the last in a line of about 10 planes waiting for take-off. We weren't leaving anytime soon.I also have been bumped from several flights in one trip. Yes, I was compensated, but I didn't appreciate having every flight I was on to be overbooked. The unfortunate part is that America West frequently has the cheapest flights when traveling from the East Coast. I would not recommend this airline. One step above Southwest.
91225;"Well we have all heard on the news in the last few weeks how America West has lost some kids on flights and not told their parents etc where they shipped them off to. Well those turned out ok, the kids finally got to their destinations as did I but it was not easy. Last week I had a planned trip to meet a friend in Las Vegas for a 4 day trip. Airfare was super cheap at $60 round trip for me. I guess I got what I paid for. I get to my airport 1 hour and 15 minutes before my flight and see that everything is one time so I go have a seat in the terminal. About 20 minutes later I pass by the monitors again and see that it is 40 minutes late now. I figure no big deal and I go get a cup of coffee. On my way back to the gate I look again and it is at a hour late. By the time I get to the gate the desk workers said ""well it is delayed a hour but it really could be more like TWO hours"". Once I am in the air it only takes me ONE hour to get to Vegas! This was getting ridiculous really fast. So then I get in line with the rest of the people wondering what their next move was. AW sends me to another terminal to get on standby with SouthWest Airlines next flight out. I run from one terminal to the other because I have 20 minutes to get there and it is a bit of a jog away. I get there and sure enough they could not get me on the plane. I then wait for the next SW flight about 45 minutes later and they squeeze me on there. This is something funny. I knew my friend would be in the Vegas airport at noon waiting for me so I asked the people at the AW desk if I could have them page her to tell her I was going ot be in a different flight. They said no and handed me a ""courtesy"" 5 minute calling card and told me to call her directly. Now how am I supposed to call anyone directly when they are sitting in a airport terminal? By the end of my little adventure I was 3 1/2 hours late to Vegas. The window seat I had paid extra for was long gone and I got stuck in aisle seat on a different airline. I am not a good flier and a bit clausterphobic so I pay extra for window seats."
95087;"We recently took a vacation, the whole little familia, all five of us. Our flying time was short (only 2 hrs. 25 min.) and over course we had the obligatory lay over in PHX. Our trip to our destination went off almost hitchless, there was one small glitch which resulted in getting in one hour late, but if that was the worst that was fine. The return trip was a whole different story ! Our flight was scheduled to leave at 9:45 AM, we arrived at the airport at 8:15 (Plenty of time) We stood in a LONG line outside to check in with the sky cap only to hear an announcement stating that our flight had been cancelled !! Cancelled !!! Not delayed, just plain cancelled ! They then instructed us to go get in line inside to be rebooked. Inside was chaos !! We waited in that line for TWO hours !! The ticketing agents at the counter completely lost control of the crowd. People would walk up to the counter and they would take them instead of sending them back to the line. They would call out certain flight numbers and get those passengers checked in, mean while our whole flight full waited, and waited, then waited some more. When my family finally reached the front of the line, I saw a ticket agent become available and went to her counter only to be told that she hadn't called me to her !!! Pardon me Miss Manners ! Then a whole slew of ticket agents went on break while the line was still huge...that I do not understand !! Eventually we were helped by a very nice man named Sam that did his best to help us rebook and leave on a timely manner.....thank you Sam ! There was another glitch. Three of us were checked through to our final destination, two of us had to check in and get boarding passes in PHX. When I went to do that it was then that I realized Sam had kept the wrong part of my ticket. I had the part that said LAX to PHX, and I needed to have PHX to DEN. I didn't think it was a huge deal, I figured they could look it up. The agent at the counter was rude and kept saying just step over and look through all your things. I kept telling her that I could look through my things the rest of the day and not find another ticket, that was it, all I had !! She then gave me this analogy: She said ""Just like going to a ballpark, you need a ticket to get it"" I UNDERSTAND that, what I'm telling you is *I* don't have it, it's back in LA, and that is my fault how?! She finally relented and gave us boarding passes but she was not happy in doing so. It was then we found out that we all had different seating assignments. This was fine except I have a four year old. One of us needed to be seated by him. When I pointed this out to the same ticket agent she lectured me about getting seating assignments when I make the reservation. I calmly explained to her that *I* had done that, I held up my end of the bargain, it was the airline that messed that all up with the original cancellation !! She wouldn't relent and said if he had to sit by himself then so be it !! Ridiculous !! We finally did arrive home, approximately 5 hrs. later than originally planned. I don't even blame the airline for the cancellation, what I do hold them accountable for is the demeanor of their employees. I understand that it was stressful, but we travellers were also stressed and we were expected to behave in an orderly fashion, and behave with manners. All in all the airline itself was ok. Not outstanding, but certainly not the worst either. Their customer service on the other hand was way at the bottom of the scale. In the future even if I do find a low fare on America West (as I did this trip), I'd have to think twice, or maybe three times before purchasing a ticket through them."
100622;Wow. that pretty much sums up what i have to say for america west airlines. This airline makes flying fun. i have been using america west for just a few months now but i can tell you right now that this is definately one of the best airlines i have ever traveled upon. my trip was comfortable, the food was quite tasty, the service was nothing short of excellent and the seats were COMFORTABLE! i fell asleep before the plane even took off the last time i traveled with america west. i think that it is pretty easy to see that i highly recommend america west! enjoy. If you think i write a halfway decent reveiw and you agree with my opinions on products dont be afraid to give me an email at Prizice24@aol.com and also dont be afraid to check out my account and look at some of my other opinions.
110501;"I have flown American West several times, and not always by choice. A couple of times I was booked on to them through my employer and a couple of times I thought I was buying a ticket through another airline at a great price, only to discover it was a ""partner"" of America West. I have NEVER had a pleasant experience aboard this airline. The crews are consistently rude from city to city. They pay no special attention the weary traveler or the special needs traveler. The constant delays were shocking. There is no smile, no sincerity. Their employees consistently seem unhappy. The worst, however, was during a business trip. My bag with all clothing was lost. I had a business conference the next morning, including a presentation to more than a hundred people and all I had were the sweater and jeans I was wearing. The gave me the most RIDICULOUS little ""overnight"" kit with a toothbrush and some soap in it. The woman handling the 6 or 7 of us who had lost baggage was exceptionally rude and uncaring. I asked how the airline intended to accommodate me as I needed to have SOMETHING to wear the next day and she told me that they would do nothing for me until the next business day if my bags were still lost. Flights are often late. Seats were average, a little on the small side but not too horrible. Food? What food? My bag was delivered to my hotel in the wee hours of the morning. It was ripped and filthy, but at least the hotel had a facility to press my suit before my meeting. Thank goodness for the hotel, as they had to compensate for the total disregard for courtesy of America West. I will never fly America West again. I have actually canceled a trip at the airport when I discovered I was code sharing with a partner of America West. I am always looking for a bargain, but will not give them my business again."
111763;"Sometimes you try something new, sometimes you pay the price. Normally, I take American out of Long Beach when I visit my folks in Oklahoma City. Long Beach Airport is small (the terminals are not much more than trailers and you have to walk outside to board), and Will Rogers Airport in Oklahoma City is not much bigger, so choices are limited. But, planning for this past Christmas, after American's web site kicked me off just as I was ready to select a flight, I saw that America West was an option and checked it out. The web site, like Southwest's and Jet Blue's and unlike American's, lets you scroll back and forth to compare fares on adjacent days. The flight I selected was about fifty dollars cheaper than the American flight I initially tried to buy. From there, it went downhill. After rushing into the airplane because of the long security checkpoint line, I sat in the airplane for two hours on the strip as the pilot waited for the fog to lift. (I guess we were lucky - one of the planes in front of us had to taxi back to the terminal for more fuel) I don't hold America West or the pilot responsible for the fog - that's just bad luck. And the flight itself was OK. The plane seemed in good condition and clean, and the flight attendants were not particularly cheerful but seemed courteous and professional. The only complaint that I and everyone else who bumped their head on the overhead compartment and had trouble turning around in the bathroom was that the plane was really small. Things got bad in Phoenix. Upon landing the flight attendant announced that our connection information would be available at the gate. So the contents of this flight disembark and mill around the desk until the woman at the counter starts yelling out names. When she eventually stops, there's a smaller crowd milling around, which she directs to customer service across the way. Where's customer service? ""Over there!"" she yells and points impatiently as we remainders wander into traffic. I forgo lunch thinking I'd better not risk missing my connecting flight or its replacement. Two hours later, after moving five feet forward in the customer service line, I realize that was a mistake. Finally, I make it up to one of the two attendants handling this line (it started with five and seems to have dwindled - maybe they too my lunch idea), and I'm informed that I've been rescheduled for the same connecting flight, but tomorrow. ""Are you going to pay for a hotel?"" ""No - it was a weather delay, which is not our responsibility, but here's a number you can call for a discount on a hotel stay."" The attendant also put me on standby for a later flight that day, and took it manfully when I asked ""Is there any reason that I couldn't have received this information at the gate instead of waiting for two hours?"" ""Sir, you're right, they could have looked it up then."" Fortunately, I had the rest of the day in the airport to simmer down and notice that while I'd been waiting in line for two hours, there were plenty of other customer service reps at other stations just sitting around. I also checked Southwest, where the much perkier and helpful agent told me they had plenty of seats available on their next flight and allowed me to get a ticket on hold without purchase just in case I needed it. Alas, an America West agent informed me they don't have an arrangement with Southwest. I did make the standby flight - as in a really bad game show, I was the last one selected among the group of us standby contestants. In a bid for good karma, I volunteered to give up my place to the couple carrying a little dog. since there were actually two seats left on the plane, but I think the attendant/game-show-host got confused by the math. I heard there were a couple of other standby's who didn't even show up and planned to hang out in the airport bar overnight (guess that hotel discount wasn't compelling). So I went on the plane and was treated to the entertainment of a couple ignoring the flight attendant's instruction to turn off their cell phones and subsequently being led off by TSA personnel and sternly lectured at Will Rogers Airport. I thought myself lucky to arrive at my destination in one day, but wrong again. Checking into Will Rogers for my return flight, the agent typed in my flight info and said ""uh oh"". Apparently, since I'd arrived on a standby flight instead of my confirmed replacement flight, America West had assumed I didn't arrive and thus cancelled my return flight. This makes perfect sense if you realize they overbooked their flights by ten passengers at a time. Complicating this, America West has a gate-sharing agreement with Continental at Will Rogers. So I waited while the Continental agent called America West and was put on hold much like I would have been. After maybe twenty minutes I got on a standby flight again, only this time I lost the game and waited three hours while the gate attendants processed everyone who didn't make it. Now, Continental used to be my least favorite airline, but at this time I felt some sympathy while they tried to clean up someone else's problem. They managed to find an American flight for me (some irony there) going to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, necessitating a taxi ride or Super Shuttle to pick up my car in Long Beach. Adding insult to injury, the American agent who processed my ticket the next day decided by whatever mysterious criteria they use to stamp SSSS on my boarding pass, so I was given the bonus frisking experience my second consecutive day passing through the same security checkpoint. Since weather couldn't be blamed on this last one day delay, and perhaps since I wasn't dealing with America West personnel, I came away with vouchers for one day's worth of hotel and meals - if you stay at cheap hotels and don't eat much. Sixty dollars for a hotel and twenty for meals (five for breakfast, five for lunch and ten for dinner). I blew the meal money on six bottled drinks at the airport. Also, one three hundred dollar voucher for another America West flight. Now, besides why would I ever want to fly on that airline again, this begs the question - was overbooking my $350 flight really worth it to America West? What kind of business model is that?"
128001;I've flown the Detroit - Phoenix - San Jose connection a couple of times in the last year and a half. Generally speaking fares from Detroit are high, and it's often the case that America West will come in with a fare several hundred dollars less than the competition. Being frugal, I usually go for it, even though the travel south through Phoenix is a bit out of the way. The experience in the air is very much like being on a nice bus, it gets you there, it's not exceptionally roomy, really not much to say other than it seems to be acceptable for utilitarian air travel. The experience on the ground in Phoenix making connections is quite reasonable, the airport is well laid out and roomy enough not to make the trek from gate to gate an ordeal. It does not, however, have enough power outlets to guarantee a space to plug in a laptop wherever you sit down. Not a luxury experience, but I can count on getting there and back without having to make a mad dash through a weird airport. thanks Ed
133513;"America West offers lower prices for direct flights from coast to coast but the flights can be unreliable. You can save a lot of money but be prepared for delayed and cancelled flights. Do not take America West if you need to get to your destination by a certain time for an important appointment. I just flew back from San Francisco on a flight originally booked with America West and am disappointed with how they treated their passengers. Me and a plane-load of people were ready to head from San Francisco to Baltimore at 3pm on Saturday afternoon. When we arrived at the airport we were told that the 3pm flight was &quot;delayed&quot;, and given no other information. We were forced to stay at the airport the whole day awaiting news about the flight. Five hours later (8pm) we were told we were being booked on a 9:30pm US Air flight. We could have been told this earlier and had the day to enjoy instead of waiting around the airport hoping for some news. This I blame America West for completely. We never did get an explanation on why the flight was cancelled. Of course the next morning Baltimore was fogged in so we circled for almost two hours before we were diverted to Philadelphia and waited around for another two hours before US Air decided to ship us down to Baltimore on Amtrak. I was glad not to have to fly again. I know that the weather conditions were not America West's fault, but since we were originally bumped we had no leverage with US Air and US Air was doing us a &quot;favor&quot; by paying for our train fares. The total trip took 20 hours while it normally takes less than 5. Be careful of America West's good fares. This is my first time flying with them and I will probably not fly with them again. I heard warnings before and should have listened to them."
145058;Avoid flying with America West if you can! I have had the displeasure of flying with them once, and have had several friends, relatives, and colleagues fly with them. Not a one good experience have they had!! Most of their problems stem from cancelled, delayed, or late flights. Their people are also rather rude. There is nothing worse than having to fly somewhere in the morning, sit in meetings all day, then look forward to getting back home only to get to the airport and find your flight has been CANCELLED! I know somebody who took one of their flights, and shortly after take off one of the engines went out and they had to land again. That really stinks! I have found Southwest Airlines to be much more dependable. I would take them over America Worst, even if I have to give my Corporate Travel department a few extra bucks to get that flight.
157964;I am writing to express my extreme gratification at the professional, beyond the call of duty, efforts of their employee Yvonne M. The initial story: On the morning of June 16th, coming home from a conference in Portland, I missed my flight. I was late, it was my fault, and quite frankly (since I am a poor graduate student with little chance to fly and therefore didn&#146t know their policies and procedures) I was quite concerned about how, exactly, I was going to get home. However, their front end folks, the people at the boarding terminal desk, reassured me that they would find me a flight home to my wife and kids. Super. I bought a book to read and proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. Each flight came and went, packed full. I even wondered - how could the airlines be losing money with every flight jam-packed solid? The continuing story: I had called my wife to let her know I was going to be late. However, by mid afternoon, after seeing almost a dozen planes come and go, I was beginning to get quite worried. We had our summer vacation planned, leaving to catch a train that Saturday, going across the country from Michigan to Arizona and a rental camper return, almost three weeks roundtrip, and there was every indication that I might not get home in time. They were very understanding and kept checking for open seats, but the flights were completely full for the rest of the day and into the next (that Friday). The happy conclusion: Without my knowing it (most likely because she didn&#146t want to get my hopes up) Yvonne spent a considerable amount of time hunting flights, even other airlines, and finally found me a direct flight home, from Seattle, on another airline, the last seat available! As I started looking into renting a car to drive from Portland to Seattle, (she was furiously typing away at her computer at this point), she looked up with glee, she was able to find me a shuttle flight up to the Seattle airport, also one of the last seats. I strongly imagine that this set of flights cost more than my original flight home, but Yvonne and America West took care of me, and didn&#146t even ask me to compensate for the difference in costs. This is Customer Care at its best. I cannot begin to express how happy I was to get home that Friday morning just as my wife was going off to work and my children were going off to school. We were able to have our planned summer vacation! Just today I had to book a flight to a conference in California, and as you could imagine, I went with America West.
161932;"We flew direct flight from Milwaukee, WI to Las Vegas, NV. We did this in Jan 00 and Nov 99. We flew America West for 2, no 3 reasons. The first reason was, of course, the direct flight (to Vegas). The second was cost--they were much cheaper than other flights if you took the red-eye flight, which left Milwaukee anywhere from 5pm-8pm. In January, we flew America West because the #1 &amp; #2, but also in the prior Nov, Thanksgiving week, we gave up our seats and took the $300 certificate for this January ticket. This year I have made 2 other airfare flights, (one didn't have America West flights) but comparing costs for America West red-eye, where we'd pay an extra night hotel than arriving in the morning, was nowhere near the cost of a connecting flight of another airline. If America West wants to fill their red-eye flights, it should be a GOOD discount. So, though I've flown America West for 3 round trip flights in the last 2 1/2 years, 2 to Vegas and 1 to San Diego, I will have to see a greater discount before I take a red-eye flight. Still, I have not had any trouble with America West that I haven't had with other airlines, i.e. late or cancelled flights. My recommendations: good deal for red-eye, direct flights IF the price is lower than other airlines."
164729;Last month I traveled to Phoenix for a long weekend. It provided me the opportunity to escape the unusually wet weather we were having in California as well as allow me to catch the final days of baseball&#146s Spring Training. I have a friend who lives in Phoenix, so my lodging was covered. The only thing I needed to do was to book a flight. My friend swore by Southwest Airlines and said he routinely flies roundtrip from Phoenix to the Bay Area for under $200. So that was the price I was shooting for. However, I couldn&#146t put together a ticket package anywhere near that price, either through my AAA travel agent or directly on the Southwest website. My friend seemed surprised, but considering I was making a reservation less than three weeks from my travel date, and at the heart of Spring Break, I wasn&#146t particularly surprised. So, I went online to Expedia.com and searched for the best priced direct flight within my travel parameters. It came up with America West at $255 roundtrip. I sighed and made the reservation. Score 1 star for having the lowest-priced roundtrip flight. When I booked the flight, I was slightly confused because my Expedia receipt and itinerary listed both America West and US Airways, but with separate flight numbers. I&#146m a little behind the times on these things, so I did some research on America West&#146s website and discovered that the two airlines merged in May 2005. A quote on the site says America West and US Airways are &#147joining together to create the world&#146s largest low-fare airline.&#148 It goes on to claim that the merger makes them the fifth largest domestic airline. Even with that information tucked away in my noggin, when I arrived at the Oakland International Airport (my origin), I was puzzled to see employees in US Airways uniforms working the America West check-in counter. Possibly because there wasn&#146t a line, one employee was stationed at the computer screen in front of the counter that issues boarding passes. I played dumb (I&#146ve been told I&#146m a natural) and let her walk me through the procedure of entering my name, flight number, and a credit card (for identity verification purposes only) in order to get my paper boarding pass. Score 1 star for friendly customer service. I have read where US Airways has a reputation of losing luggage at a higher rate than the average airline. Indeed, on their web page there is a link to a recent press release stating just that. However, I cannot comment on that as I brought just one carry-on piece with me. I try to travel as light as possible, and for the four-night weekend I had planned, all of my stuff fit neatly inside a regular-sized backpack. After I made my way to the boarding gate, it wasn&#146t long before an announcement was made that this Friday afternoon flight was overbooked. The attendants (still all US Airways staff) took turns pitching free round-trip flights to anywhere within the continental US, cash back (my ears heard $100, though they may have upped the ante later), and a one-night stay in beautiful, downtown Oakland to any passengers willing to give up their seats for a later flight. A few people jumped at the chance, including one woman who was looking to trade in her ticket for a flight to Tucson. After the trading and haggling was over, we ready to board the plane. The plane waiting for us was an American West Airbus A319, apparently the American West portion of the merger. The attendant announced the sections not in seats, but in zones, so there was a little confusion among us simple folk in the crowd until we figured out that the zone number was printed on our boarding passes. Once inside the plane, I noticed a small pillow was placed on each seat, but not a blanket could be found. I liked the legroom that my seat offered&#151it seemed to be a bit more generous than in other planes. As I mentioned, the plane had been overbooked, so the flight was full. For a number of people, that meant that room was limited for their carry-on luggage. I was able to fit my backpack under the seat in front of me, so I didn&#146t have to worry. But others were getting frustrated at the lack of space and some had to have their luggage tagged and placed in the hold. Deduct 1 star for passenger frustration Even after the luggage situation was resolved, we weren&#146t ready to fly. It seems that the woman who wanted to go to Tucson somehow was on our flight. She explained to one of the flight attendants that she had given up her seat, only to be called back into it. The attendant, a young woman, was rather abrupt, saying that it was the responsibility of those at the gate, not inside the plane, to take care of passengers&#146 special travel accommodations. That said, the Tucson passenger was whisked off the plane and we were shortly ready for departure. Deduct 1 star for observed rudeness The travel time from Oakland to Phoenix was originally to be two hours. However, with the delays we got off the ground 30 minutes late. So, it was a surprising relief when the pilot announced that he would be able to get us into Phoenix within 90 minutes of take off. He kept his word, too, for we landed in Phoenix ahead of time. Score 1 star for a quick flight The flight itself went smoothly. All passengers were offered a choice of drink, with a refill, and a packet of honey roasted peanuts. I took a quick nap and when I awoke we were about make our descent. Score 1 star for in-flight service My return flight, on a Tuesday morning, started out much smoother than my departure. From my friend&#146s computer, I printed my boarding pass the night before using my confirmation code (a six letter security code given out with my receipt). The flight was not full, so there was nobody scurrying around or waiting with baited breath to see if they would make it onto the plane. Again, we boarded an America West plane, this time a Boeing 737. Score 1 star for a hassle free flight check-in The weather wasn&#146t as nice (it was actually raining in Phoenix the day I left), so the flight was much rougher than coming down. Because of that, we landed in Oakland about 20 minutes behind schedule as the plane circled around the area until the wind died down. According to the pilot, it was illegal to attempt to land a craft our size with wind gusts above 40 mph. The service on the return flight was similar to my outbound flight. Small pillows were waiting on each seat, but no blanket. Every passenger was offered a packet of peanuts and a drink, but perhaps due to the turbulence the flight attendants did not pass through a second time offering refills. No stars added or subtracted for return flight So, in sum I give America West, US Airways, or whatever they want to call themselves, positive points for having a low fare, an on-time flight, and a good personal interaction with their customer service. My overall experience was a satisfactory one. I wasn&#146t wowed by their overall service, especially with the way they handled a crowded plane, but they did nothing to dissuade me from flying with them again.
171413;I have heard nothing by horror stories about America West. Imagine my chagrin when I was transferred from a Northwest flight to America West due to a snowstorm and delayed flights. What could I do? I just had to suck it up and get on the plane. Wow. I was so impressed. Because I had been transferred between airlines, my vegetarian meal was no longer available. The flight attendant found me a meal anyway. She then checked on me later to see if it was satisfactory. She let me switch seats (not uncommon on most airlines but part of a pattern of helpfulness on her part) so I could sit next to a window. She identified who throughout the cabin needed special assistance by pure observation and then worked especially hard to make sure their trip was comfortable. I have never seen such incredible service on an American airline. It was the type of service I expect in Business class on Thai airlines, not in coach on an American airline. My head is still reeling from the shock. The rest of the flight was good, too. Although we left about 30 minutes late (snowstorms, remember?), we arrived 30 minutes early. I'm still confused about that. Impressed but confused. The seats were comfortable. Comfortable seats in coach? That's as close to impossible as I've ever seen. The movie screens were well placed throughout the cabin. The captain was informative and helpful in his announcements. The food was good. How is that so? It was airline food and it was good. My confusion continues. In fact, my only complaint was the cost of renting headphones for the movie. Five dollars is a bit excessive. I can rent the movie and watch it on a big screen at home with popcorn and a comfy couch for less than that. Overall, I have to say that this was the best flight I've had on an American airline in years. Perhaps I'll find once I've travelled on America West more that it was an anomaly but I've found that generally, airlines tend to be relatively the same with all their flights. If so, I have found a new airline with whom to fly.
172173;"Am I crazy or just a bit odd? I found turbulence to be one of the coolest experiences in my young life. My non-stop flight from Ohio to Las Vegas was filled with it. I started to freak out at first, of course, but I realized that I could either freak or enjoy the ride. I decided to do the later, and really enjoyed my trip. Until a couple of weeks ago, I hadn't set foot on an airplane for over 15 years. I was a bit timid about getting on a plane again, especially with all those horror stories and the Concorde crash that happened a few days before. In that decade and a half, I established a very strong fear of heights, and figured it would get to me. But as I sat there, all I could think about is how they put a whole bunch of people in this big tin can and hurled it through the sky at high speeds, and how absolutely cool the entire concept of that is. The plane that we rode on both ways was an Airbus, a smaller jet liner with 3 seats per row on each side. The seats were spacious and comfortable but didn't lean back very far. While this made it hard to doze off, it did prove a blessing as I still had plenty of leg room despite the person in front of me being fully reclined. They did show in flight movies, a commodity that was almost non-existent the last time I flew. The films were, as would be expected, romancy human spirit type films like Erin Brockovich. They also had some shorts like music videos thrown in. It cost 5 dollars to rent head phones, but you could see the screen for free, so I guess it's a bargain if you lip read. I preferred looking out the window and watching the land change with the different climates and environments, the farms and mountains, the desert winding roads. I saw the different shapes of farm fields due to different types of irrigation, from the rectangular corn fields of my native Ohio to the circular fields of the plains states. I cuddled up with my husband as we pointed Hoover Dam, the south end of the Grand Canyon, cities, cloud formations out to each other. It was amazing. Everyone else on the plane seemed to like the movie just fine. The food was, well, everything you ever heard about airplane food. It was about cafeteria level. I do have additional gripes however, because I'm a vegetarian. (Don't I usually?) When I ordered the tickets, I was a bit worried. The vegetarian meal was listed as &quot;True Vegetarian&quot; which I took to mean vegan. No offense to vegans, but I fear anything that an airline would concoct that would be vegan. I chose &quot;True Vegetarian&quot;, but made a pact with my lactose intolerant husband that we'd just divvy up what we could eat between us. Well, we were served breakfast on the flight out. The regular meal was cereal with milk and these nasty egg and cheese rolls. That was okay with me, and I told my husband to take the vegetarian meal, still figuring it would be vegan. No, it wasn't vegan. It was french toast and sausage. Let's think about this for a moment. I read The Jungle at a pretty young age. I've smelled scents coming out of the Kahn's meat packing plant that you don't want to know about. Even before I became a vegetarian, I didn't eat sausage. I'm a very laid back vegetarian, but I will be the first to tell you, loudly, that sausage doesn't count. However, my husband ate it, and even mentioned that although a little over cooked, it was pretty good. On the flight back, the vegetarian meal was closer. It was actually a pretty delicious serving of cheese lasagna which caused me to get envious stares from the other passengers as they tolerantly ate their overcooked cheese burgers. The package of Oreos that came with it, however, was not vegetarian (There's lard in the filling. Check the label.) They gave this to me, despite the fact that the small bars of Toblerone given to the meat eaters are vegetarian. Sigh. There's a reason why I'm telling you this. If you eat meat and are going to fly America West, by all means get the vegetarian meal. The food quality was far superior to that of the regular meals, and it didn't come out of plastic bags. If you are a vegetarian, be prepared for a partial meal. If you are vegan, pack a lunch. The staff was professional but not astounding. Despite the heavy turbulence on the flight out, I was very impressed by the first pilot. He changed routes because of weather and took off and landed seamlessly. I really enjoyed my flights, though I can't tell you how much of it was because of the airline itself as opposed to the shear wonder of flying. Despite the food issues, I was overall impressed with America West. It was a direct flight with some amenities for a good price."
178549;If you read my last review, you know that we had to change our planned vacation on rather short notice. Instead of a European vacation, we had to shorten the length of our trip and stay closer to home. We decided to go to a familiar and favorite U.S destination. We had to fly from Indiana to Tucson, AZ. In the past, we have always used American Airlines when flying to Tucson. However, I was booking this trip near to the departure date for travel during the Thanksgiving holiday week. The fare on American Airlines was nearly $1,000.00 per person. I decided that was just too much to pay, so I started checking my options, which aren?t many on that particular route. I was pleased to find a fare of $330.50 each on America West Airlines. It is an airline that I have never flown in the past, but for that difference in cost, I decided it would be worth it. The only negative to the reservation was the fact that I could only get a red-eye flight for the return home. Once we checked out of our accommodations, we really didn?t want to wait around Tucson until 10:30 at night for our flight. I saw that we had a connection in Las Vegas, so I asked the booking agent if they allowed a stopover on the reservation. She said they did for an additional $60.00 per ticket. I thought this was a great, as we could leave Tucson in the late afternoon and have a few hours in Vegas to have dinner and check out the sights. I was told we could check all of our luggage in Tucson, all the way to our final destination. This meant we could just grab a cab in Vegas without any hassles with luggage. It all sounded fine, so I booked the flights. As we were returning during the Thanksgiving weekend, the final flight segment from Las Vegas to Indianapolis was pretty full and they could not assign our seats at the time of booking. I was told they would have to be assigned at the airport on the day of departure. Checking in for our outbound flight was very simple and easy. The check-in agent was able to change our seats to bulkhead, which made the long flight (3 hours) to Phoenix very comfortable. It was an evening flight and a hot dinner was served. I usually don?t eat much on airplanes, but I hadn?t had a chance to eat before we left, so I did partake of this meal. There was a salad, chicken burrito, roll and a delicious almond cookie. Everything was very good for airplane food. The only negative for me with the food service is that America West serves Diet Pepsi, not Diet Coke. They offered a beverage and nut service before serving the meal and another beverage service following the meal. We arrived right on time in Phoenix, which is the location of America West?s headquarters and their main hub. Their gate areas were quite extensive. The gate for our connecting flight to Tucson was located in another concourse, but there are moving sidewalks and the distance can be covered quickly. Our flight did depart late from here, but the lengthiest delay was on the runway, where we were in line for over a half hour. The flight is very short, (just up and down) so there was no in-flight service on this segment. On the return, we flew from Tucson to Phoenix to Las Vegas for our stopover. All of the flights were on time and smooth. As we checked in at Tucson, the check-in agent informed us that since we would be in Las Vegas for more than 4 hours, she could not check our luggage to our final destination. I told her that I was told when I made the reservations that they would check them all the way. She was very pleasant and checked with a supervisor, but still could not check our bags all the way. She did tell us that we could simply not collect our bags in Las Vegas and they would be locked up and we could retrieve them before checking in for our final flight. I was hesitant about doing this, but she was being helpful, so I let it go at that. I then asked her if she could assign seats for our final segment from Las Vegas to Indianapolis, since it could not be done at the time of booking. She told me that they could only be assigned four hours prior to the flight. She did say she would check to see if the flight was oversold?which it was. She continued punching buttons on her computer, then printed out a piece of paper and attached it to our ticket jacket. She said that coach was oversold by 6 seats, so she made a note to put us in First Class, although she could not yet issue the boarding passes. Needless to say, we were very pleased, especially since it was nearly a 4-hour flight. When we arrived in Las Vegas, I was too worried to just leave our luggage and hope that they would lock it up. Instead, we made our way to the baggage claim. Again, I had another excellent experience with America West. I went to the baggage office and explained our situation. The baggage agent could not have been nicer. He came right out to the baggage carousel and asked us to point out our luggage. He removed all of it and locked it right up. He told us he would be there until 2AM (our departing flight was at 1AM) and just come there to collect our luggage. As promised, the baggage agent was there and promptly retrieved our luggage. Then, he gave us two coupons for $100.00 off of our next flight with America West for our inconvenience. I thought that was very nice?and I hadn't even thought I had been inconvenienced! It was a short 3-minute walk to the check-in counters and again it went smoothly. They issued our First Class boarding passes and we were on our way. I?m afraid I can?t make too much of a comment on the service in First Class, as I went to sleep right away. But the seats were very comfy. I did wake shortly before landing and the flight attendant did ask if I would like something to drink. I thought it was very nice of her to offer as we were in the initial descent and there would have been very little time for it. The planes all appeared to be clean and in very good condition. Movies were offered on the long flights in each direction. They did charge $5.00 for the headsets in Coach. It?s been my experience in the past several years that headsets are free on other airlines. All in all, we had a great travel experience. The flight attendants were friendly and courteous on all of our flights. I have absolutely no complaints at all on the in-flight service. The customer service that I experienced in all the ground operations were terrific. I see from other reviews here on Epinions.com that not everyone has had the favorable encounter I had with America West. Maybe I was just lucky. From the lack of good customer service I've had in the past, I was pleasantly surprised with my experience with America West Airlines. I?m not certain when I will again be going somewhere that America West operates, but I certainly would not hesitate to fly them again.
179031;"I recently completed a trip with America West after not having flown with them for a year, and I'm pleased to say the airline is changing for the better. It's still not perfect. (Show me an airline that *is*.) But the improvements are a work in progress. For years, the best thing I could say about America West was that they filled two basic needs: low fares and convenient flight schedules for non-stops to Las Vegas from New York. Everything else about them -- the food, the planes, the employees' attitudes -- was bad. I flew with them only because my priority is convenience. I put up with bagged, rotten meals and broken seats in exchange for direct flights that weren't at red-eye times or at ridiculous prices. On my recent trip, the New York ground crew was great about answering my questions at the ticket counter and keeping everyone informed at the gate. (There was a slight delay because of the weather.) Even when confronted by a few irate, impatient customers, the gate attendants were pleasant. I was most pleased to see that they enforced rules about carry-on size. In the past, they didn't, and problems ensued once passengers got on board. Arguments between flight staff and passengers about last-minute baggage checking always seemed to delay the flight. Now, however, boarding seems organized, orderly and civilized. The planes to and from Vegas were spotless. Going to Vegas, I think the aircraft was brand new. My return flight was on an older plane, but everything seemed well maintained. Both planes were quite a change from the broken armrests and duct-taped seats I used to associate with America West. The airline is also serving real meals now. I'd been expecting their usual paper sack containing a dirty, stunted apple and scary headcheesy-looking sandwich. Instead, hot meals were served for both lunch and dinner, and both were accompanied by a salad. (And no, the lettuce wasn't brown.) The only minuses about America West -- at least on this recent trip -- were the following: * For the flight from New York, a co-worker who was traveling with me had requested a vegetarian meal. The request was made almost three months before the flight and confirmed again one week before the flight. On the flight, he was told, &quot;We're out of vegetarian meals. Sorry.&quot; But that doesn't make up for his being hungry on such a long flight. * The line at America West's main check-in area in Las Vegas was longer than any check-in line I'd ever seen in my many years of air travel. The airline seemed to keep the line moving pretty well, but the wait caused a few people to miss their flights. The airline didn't seem to have enough counter help to handle the crowd. The line for the skycaps outside was no better. If you are taking America West out of Vegas and you need to check bags or change seats, get to the airport at least an hour and a half before the flight. * I got to the airport early because I'm very tall and like to request an emergency-row or bulkhead seat for the extra legroom. The counterperson told me she could accommodate my request. When I got on the plane, I discovered that she seated me in the row *behind* an emergency row, not *in* the row. I was angry, but what could I do about it? The counterperson obviously made a mistake, and by the time I realized it, the plane was completely full. So, you see, America West is not perfect. Until this trip, I bashed them whenever someone mentioned them. Now the airline seems to be improving. You might want to give them a try or a second chance. At the very least, you'll save some money. And at best, you might be very pleasantly surprised."
181120;I will never (if I can help it) fly this airline again. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE LOW FARES! America West is the only airline I know of that has a scheduled arrival time fo 4 a.m. (!!), and then, with delays, has the audacity to arrive at 7 a.m., after having flown all night!!! The service is mediocre, as the airline refuses to apologize for its frequent delays and cancellations. The food is marginal, at best. the flights are often crowded or overbooked, because they cram all passengers onto their late night flights. I recently flew Delta, and experienced a three hour delay due to poor weather conditions. Delta, of their own volition, sent me a $75 voucher. I never complained - Delta just wanted to apologize. This sort of gesture would neeeeeeever be made by America West! Stay away
182767;"America West Airlines always patted themselves on the back and boasted of great customer service . In fact I was told that they were the best in the business . Well that may have been true at one time but in the past few years I have seen this airline go from ok to substandard quickly . You can almost count on every flight being overbooked . I have never seen the day where any flight I have been booked on didnt ask for volunteers to step aside and take compensation for giving up a seat . Compensation.. yea right . My daughter was booked on a flight out of Phoenix to Columbus, OH last summer . Her flight arrived in Phoenix, from Fresno, CA almost 30 minutes late . That was the beginning . Her connection to Columbus then was delayed for an hour she was told . That hour quikly turned into 7 hours and she found herself stranded at the airport at 1200 midnight . She along with about 100 angry people wanted to know what was going on since no one volunteered any info on the situation for 7 hours and no one of course could leave even to go to the bathroom or get a bite to eat . The folks at the ticket counter told people everything from mechanical problems to Bill Clinton is in Phoenix and we have to wait till he takes off . Well it turned out that Phoenix predicted a monsoon to hit and they didnt want to take the chance of flying anyone out of the airport . That was fine but why did it take 7 hours and 17 angry phone calls to AWA to get that message to 100 people waiting on a 7 hour delayed flight ? My daughter asked the airlines to provide a hotel for her and get her on the first flight out of there .Well that raised some eyebrows and AWA told her that they wouldnt do that since it wasnt their fault that her flight was delayed . The next day she still wasnt on a flight. She was due in Columbus on business and no relief in sight . I called the airline and requested that they get her on a flight of theirs or any other carrier immediately .. again No we wont .. and on and on the story goes . My daughter did make it back to Columbus 2 days later with no sleep frazzled and missing her appointment . I have had many problems also . They have ranged from being bumped from my flights , lost luggage and to top it all off I was even accosted by the man sitting next to me on a 4 hour flight . When I reported it to the steward he told me he wouldnt get involved because the man may get mad and he wouldnt chnge his seating since that would violate his rights . I said &quot;Well Change Me then &quot; the steward told me he didnt have anyone who would want to switch with me even though he never inquired . An elderly gentleman came to my rescue and switched seats . I wouldnt recomend this airline to anyone . I saw stick with who you trust and know , but dont trust AWA."
184468;On a particular journey, I waited until the last minute to get my ticket. I found a good deal with America West through the internet. The plane trip was comfortable, but somewhat crowded. The stewards were friendly and helpful. I traveled from Philadelphia to San Jose, and I was hungry, but America West does not serve meals instead they serve snack packs with not quite appetizing sandwiches, chips, and of course, peanuts. They provided us with a good movie and a not so good Snack Pack. Then again, who expects plane food to be good? Overall, I would suggest flying America West if you are in a hurry to get somewhere and need a quick cheap ticket, but I would not suggest the airline if you are planning a leisurely vacation and have plenty of time to make better plans.
187844;Four years of college on the East Coast. Home on the West Coast. $200 flights on America West. Long and bitter hours in the Las Vegas airport late at night. Cramped seats. 10-12 hours across country. Frequent chaos. Once I rode the Greyhound all the way from New York to Oregon. It was only marginally more painful than riding America West, mainly because of the pervasive scent of urine on the bus. I can also say in favor of poor old America West that I never died on a flight. I came near a couple of times, but that was just from risk of suffocation by my sprawling fellow passengers. Maybe i'd be less bitter if any of those quarters I put in those airport slot machines at 4 AM yielded anything other than nothing.
189601;This is a very helpful site. It is simple to work out what flights are available, and the pricing information is complete--and the Web specials are good! The final ticketing process is straightforward, and the receipt is easy to read. The only complaint I have is that you have to telephone after making the online reservation to get your seat assignment. But all in all, a very good site--if you plan to fly with America West!
191785;"Online Purchase I purchased my ticket online, as a last minute replacement to a canceled roadtrip. Im normally a Southwest Airlines customer, but they were sold out. So I was left with no choice. Let the trip begin. No problem purchasing my ticket, I was able to choose my seating using a chart online, I purchased my ticket and choose my seating on the expedia.com website. Round trip from San Antonio to Vegas $190. The Flight Out The flight out started with 2 pilots debating over what type of aircraft was outside the terminal. Then once on the plane, several announcements which all ended in ""this is a new aircraft"". A flight on seats hard as bricks, in a plane half the size of those I normally fly on. ""On Time"" The flight back began with my waiting at the airport, I arrived early as a precaution, but got thru checkin and security in less than 30 minutes. The flight board showed the plane ""On Time"". An hour before boarding, no plane was outside the terminal. Finally someone asked when the plane would arrive, the reponse ""Its canceled"". Needless to say people were angry, the board still said ""On Time"". Customer Service So in line at customer service I find out the people in front of me have been canceled twice, spent 24 hours flying back and forth, attempting to get a flight out. No flights are available for at least 2 days. A team of people had to be gathered, as the Customer Service desk was manned by a single woman. Once a team was assembled and the manager announced his apology, the rescheduling process began. After alot of searching, I was booked for a flight out the next morning, to Phoenix and then to Austin, Tx. ""But I wasnt going to Austin I said"" surprised they look again, and then say ""ohh theres a shuttle from Austin to San Antonio"", great, now I get a 1 hour ride in a bus or van. So they book a room, which they pay for, and I go to get my luggage. An hour and a half later, my luggage makes its appearance. Another 20 minutes, Im in a shuttle to my hotel. Apon arriving at the hotel, they are out of rooms, and upgrade me for free, only after trying to put me in a suite with a complete stranger. Next Day So I fly from Vegas to Phoenix, then a layover, and then Phoenix to Austin. I had many things happen durring the process, which werent related to America West, but made the whole process of these transfers and delays even more of a hassle. No Transportation Apon arriving in Austin, I find out first, that none of us have transportation, No shuttles. The customer service trys to locate something but says ""I wish they would tell me about these things"" and says ""I guess I'll write a voucher for a cab"" so now Im riding a cab, $168 trip from Austin to San Antonio. Conclusion I finally make it home, they have spent $45 on a room, $5 on my breakfast, $168 on a cab ride. I only paid $190 for the trip. I wonder how they make any money, but its not over yet, Im not happy with the fact they caused me all this trouble. I had to cancel plans, and arrangements at home, due to a late arrival. I called America West to complain, but the line was busy. So I emailed them. 2 weeks later, I get a voucher in the mail for $100 off my next flight. If I decide to use it, I will post an update. Lets see how they do on round 2."
194532;"I really dislike having to totally trash a product (or in this case a service) but I think that America West warrants a scathing review for their overall service. I admit that I purchased an airfare on America West because of the low cost and I'm quite willing to deal with less than perfect situations to save a buck, but in this case there were three other carriers that were at the same price point for my trip to Vegas from Indianapolis. I picked America West on a whim and boy, did I pay for it. First, the backhanded compliment...in the air they were no worse (or better) than any other economy airline. You got your bag of peanuts, and your Coke, and on the way to Vegas (the so called &quot;dinner&quot; flight) we got a small bag containing a ham sandwich, some chips and a cookie. On the downside, we were 45 minutes late leaving Indy due to &quot;equipment problems&quot; and overbooked to the point that some people (not us) were involuntarily denied boarding. In Phoenix, because of our initial delay, we had to change planes (which was not originally called for in the itinerary) and once again the plane was overbooked. A trend was appearing! After our Vegas experience (see my Boardwalk Hotel and Casino review, as well as Bellagio, Paris and the Venetian) we were booked on a red-eye back to Indy, scheduled to leave at 12:55am. You guessed it, &quot;equipment problems&quot; once again delayed our departure for 2 hours, and once again the flight was overbooked to the point that some people were denied boarding involuntarily. Worst of all, the next flight they could get on, the poor souls, was scheduled for the exact same time the next day (24 HOURS LATER). A rather exasperated comment asking if that meant the originally scheduled departure time or the current, 2 hour delayed departure time (which I thought was a hilarious question!)was met with a somewhat less than civil response. As a further note, all the America West flights out of Vegas depart from the same concourse apparently, and we heard four other flights being delayed or gate changed as we were sitting out our delay...I think America West has serious problems with their system. To the pilot's credit, he burned a lot of jet fuel on the way back to Indy, and we ended up only about 1 hour late on our arrival, but I don't think I will take a chance on this airline again, and I would wave off anyone considering it."
194713;"I have used AW twice. The first trip was a surprise trip my husband and I gave to my father and stepmom to Vegas. Upon our check in at the airport, we were told ""there was no plane"" and to come back in 3 hours. We did so, and there was still no plane, we waited another 3+ hours for the plane to arrive, with no explanations from any personel. As a matter of fact they were extremely rude. When leaving Vegas we went to our hotel's concierge desk to call AW to verify the flight was on time, and the person at the desk, when I mentioned our flight was almost 7 hours late last time, laughed and said ""America West?"". She went on to explain, that she herself worked at AW for awhile, and quit because of the lack of customer complaints at delayed and cancelled flights, and the lack of AW response to do anything about these. I complained once home with a letter to the Pres of AW, and recived four $100 vouchers for latter travel. We used these again, on a scheduled flight to Vegas 6 months later, and again waited 7+ hours for a plane. We misseda dinner celebration and a show in Vegas due to this. I again complained, and this time recieved their famous ""aircheck plus"" vouchers, ""allowing"" me discounts off further travel...$25 off ticket of $98 - 198, $50 off ticket of $199 - 298, $75 off ticket of $299-398 and $100 off ticket of $399 or more. This is completely unnaceptable to me. These vouchers are handed out freely from personell at AW, if you ask, so to compensate me with these is ridiculous. I STRONLY suggest if you ever have to get somewhere on time, or even within 7+ hours, do NOT use this airline. I will pay more for a ticket than to ever use this airlines again. They have no customer service and could care less about your travel arrangements."
206549;"Hello, its me again. Just to point this out, all my reviews are going to have the same title so you can easily identify which ones are mine. So, here I am, about to write about the America West Airlines experience. Other reports include jetBlue and South West Airlines. Here we go. THE KEY I might branch out to use codes without even realizing it, so just incase, here is what it all means. AWA- America West Airlines EWR- Newark International Airport PHX- Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport F/A- Flight Attendant(s) Here we go. This time, I mean it. FARES AND AIRLINE CHOICES FROM NEW YORK AREA Limited variety nomatter what airline you choose. Me personally, it is convenient to fly out of Newark so my choices were Continental and America West. However, it did not matter which one I chose because they code share flights. If you are signed up for OnePass, like me, you can get miles even if you fly America West and vise versa. I have flown Continental before so I chose to try something different this time, AWA. The fare was the same as Continentals, about 450 per passenger Round Trip. Its a pretty average price, but I am sure they come cheaper. THE DOWNGRADE Originally, my flights were scheduled on Airbus A320's which makes up the bulk of the AWA fleet alongside their 737's by Boeing. I learned by my constant nagging to the airline that this flight was over sold. How pleasant. Three days later I get the call from AWA saying the aircraft was downgraded to an Airbus A319 and they were now short about 24 seats. Plus however many they oversold. How convenient, right? Make a bad matter go from worse to as bad is it can get. They are also changing the flight number and delaying the scheduled time by 20 minutes. Fine, whatever...just dont EVER do this again. CHECKING IN Fine, relatively painless. The agents worked fast and efficiently although rarely showed a smile on their face. They dont need to be super nice, as long as they do their job I suppose. BOARDING Some airlines have their own special way of boarding their airplanes, like jetBlue and Southwest, however America West follows the traditional back to front system. It took them about 30 minutes to cut passengers off the flights by randomly selecting them as they boarded. The whole boarding process, to get 124 people on a plane, took about a half an hour. That is why they pushed the flight sched. back would be my guess...they needed the extra time. THE AIRPLANE It was easy to tell that this was not on of America Wests planes just because of their seating arrangement. I learned from pictures and experience that they have about 30,000,000 different ones, but this one I had never seen. The seats were much wider and looked a lot nicer tying in greens and blues with winged head rests and the works...The plane was spotless and bright and cheery. Legroom was pretty good in the front of the plane, but the further back you went, the less you had. I believe the pitch went down from 33"" in the front to about 30"" in the back. Pitch is the space between an object on your seat and the same object on the seat infront of you. THE CREW Friendly enough. Not very accomodating, but they smiled every now and then and did their jobs fine. As it turns out, we had had this F/A before on a previous AWA flight. They were nothing special and nothing short or above average. THE INFLIGHT SERVICE For America West, above and beyond. Actually, with any major airline, above and beyond. I was pleasantly surprised to be offered fruit crapes, a fresh fruit bowl, nutra grain bar, and cereal all on a tray, not a bag. They also served snacks which consisted of granola and donuts. The granola was very very good. The movie was Flubber. The F/A's couldnt get the screens to stay down for a while, but after about 9 attempts, they finally got it right. The flight home was inadequately serviced and the meals along with the hot drinks were forgotten. How can that possible slip by the flight crew? So we spent 5 hours eating that delicious (not sarcasm) granola and watching Family Man. Overall, America West has improved greatly and I would highly reccomend them as long as you make sure you choose a flight that says A319 or 737 on it. Otherwise, you might be effected by a downgrading of the aircraft. I would reccomend AWA to anybody, but they are not always the cheapest."
207288;"I flew home to Boston from Phoenix yesterday on America West. I arrived early for my 9AM flight. To America West's credit, they had the check-in counters well manned, keeping check-in lines to a minimum. The monitors clearly showed my flight delayed to about 9:30 ... Not a problem! I killed some time looking around Sky Harbor Airport's beautiful &quot;southwestern&quot; shops. I reported to the gate and we were loaded on the Airbus A319 aircraft. We backed away from the gate about 9:45, a bit late, but not bad at all. We taxied for quite awhile, got in line for take-off and waited. After a moderate wait, we were number two for takeoff. Then, the Captain casually announced to the passengers that we needed to return to the gate to pick up a crew-member. The passengers were confused. Did our flight or cabin crew accidentally leave someone behind, or were they actually turning a full plane-load of passengers around to pick up an employee they needed to transport? Both possibilities seemed ridiculous. It turned out to be the latter. We had to pick up a Captain who needed to be in Boston. We parked at a gate. To make things worse, they failed to communicate adequately to have the Captain waiting at the gate, resulting in an additional 15 minute delay. The flight was completely full, so a First Class seat on the next flight to Boston and a $400 travel voucher was offered, for anyone who would vacate a seat to make room for their &quot;precious cargo&quot;. This was quickly snapped up. A funny sidebar to that story. The cabin crew announced that none of this was the boarding crew-member's fault, and requested that we be courteous to him. While most of us complied, a few passengers &quot;boo'd&quot; when he boarded. In addition, the general hostility of the passengers could be felt throughout the cabin. He never did use the seat they had arranged for him. I suspect that he wisely chose to ride jump-seat in the cockpit. We departed, encountered weather delays, and arrived at Boston's Logan Airport at around 8:00, about three hours late. I'm a seasoned traveller. As a general rule, if an airline gets me safely and comfortably to my destination, I don't let a 3-hour delay bother me. What does bother me is an airline feeling that they have every right to inconvenience a FULL plane-load of paying passengers (My round-trip ticket was over $1400.) to use a revenue-service flight as their own personal delivery vehicle. I guess America West is working hard to continue to earn their widespread nickname, &quot;America's Worst&quot;."
218701;"I have flown with this pathetic excuse for an airline on two occasions now, and I will NEVER do it again. Both times were round trip to Mexico, the first from Chicago-Puerto Vallarta, the second from Palm Springs, CA- Acapulco. The first time I thought maybe it was just a bad flight. Rude flight attendants, poor excuse for a meal, and downright scary planes. I am a very polite traveler, I do not make unreasonable requests of flight attendants. However, when I am asked if I would like anything, and my request for a coke is met wth much eye-rolling and grumbling, that is uncalled for. And how about those snack sacks, huh? At the airport end of the jetway, there is a large rolling cooler, containing enough &quot;meals&quot; for the plane (allegedly). This consisted of a teeny-tiny sandwich, a bag of potato chips, and a can of coke. This was a BREAKFAST flight, keep in mind. They didn't have enough of these little bags of joy for each passenger, and had to hunt down some more from God-knows-where. And don't even get me started on the plane itself! This thing had duct tape clearly visible on the wing. I was about to write my will on a cocktail napkin...I decided to give them a second chance, partially because scheduled service from Palm Springs is very limited, and I was traveling on very short notice. Big surprise that America West had plenty of seats left!! Second time was no better, and let me assure you, there won't be a third."
219473;"The staff members are friendly, check-in is quick and easy, and the ticket prices are very reasonable. BUT...I've never flown an airline that is sooo unorganized at their hub. In this case, that's Phoenix. A story (if I may): We recently flew from Des Moines to San Francisco, via Phoenix, for a business/pleasure trip. Baggage check, etc. went very well in DSM, but upon arrival in Phoenix, things went haywire! We boarded our flight to SFO on time and taxied to the runway on schedule. Then, we sat there for an hour while they tried to fix a flight computer. Once they'd determined they couldn't fix it quickly, they let us off the plane and we sat in the terminal for a little more than an additional hour. At that time, they cancelled the flight and blamed it on &quot;weather.&quot; In Phoenix, AZ. In the middle of the desert. We were forced to wait for the next flight with available seats (8 more hours). Even if we were to chalk that up to just having an isolated bad experience, I noticed something else at the airport in Phoenix. America West was CONSTANTLY changing the Gate number for many of their flights. It was very common to see passengers running from one concourse to another as their gate number suddenly changed. Other than that one experience, I must say that the flights were very good, the planes were comfortable, and the crew of each plane we flew on was very nice. I wouldn't advise flying through America West's hub if at all possible, though!"
222315;"We flew America West to Las Vegas in late November, for a convention. We flew because that's who my travel agency booked us on, because my company insists on the lowest fare. So, we flew from Baltimore direct to Las Vegas, on America West, two days after Thanksgiving. Of course the plan was crowded, and slow in boarding, which is expected. But dirty and old looking, is a little too much. But we did get there, approximately at the time we had planned. Coming back ws a completely different story. First, despite the fact that Las Vegas is a major airport for America West, they had only one person checking bags curbside, and a line that filled the whole curb area for about 250 square feet. They were slow, and not particularly concerned with whether people had a flight in ten minutes or two hours. It turns out that those who were running late didn't need to worry, since all of America West's flights were running late also. Our flight, was delayed for two hours, because, get this, the crew had not shown up. We were told that since the flight had a mechanical problem, the crew had been sent off for lunch. Once the problem was fixed, the crew was still not back. So the two hundred or so passengers waited, until the six crew persons casually showed up. When we did finally get boarded, we got not even an &quot;I'm sorry&quot; from the sullen crew. From the folks at checkin, to the flight attendants, these employees were all rude, and acted as though they really resented having to deal with passengers. What a great attitude. Never again on America West."
223092;"I have flown America West a total of two times, and neither time enjoyable. As a matter of fact the only way it could have gotten worse is if it had crashed. I was scheduled to fly from Chicago to Seattle, round trip, with a stopover in Las Vegas both ways. I was two hours late getting into Seattle on the first flight, but other than that it was almost decent. On the return flight there were mechanical problems in Las Vegas, and we were told it would be an hour or so delay. We were all asked to stay close to the gate, as we could be boarding at any time. I ended up staying in Las Vegas for a total of nine hours. We were constantly told that the aircraft would be ready to fly in another hour. At no time were any of the people on the flight asked if they would like a hotel room, nor was anyone compensated for their delay. The only thing we were told was that we could book a flight on another airline, but that it would be at our own expense. I was supposed to have a nine and a half hour layover in Chicago, waiting for a United airline flight. Of course I missed it, by over an hour. If all of that was not bad enough, the seating on the airplane was horrible. I am not a very tall person(6'0"" with a 32"" inseam), but I had barely an inch of clearance between my knees and the seat in front of me, with both of us sitting straight up. Once the person in front of me reclined, I had absolutely no room and had to ask him to sit up. I don't know about you, but I sure do not like the idea of sitting up straight for a three hour flight. I have also talked to several other people about their ordeals with America West, and they all have similar horror stories. In every way America West was a bad experience. Avoid it like the plague."
231292;"I have flown many airlines due to my husband's military status and I will tell you honestly , I never want to fly America West again. I was taking a trip with my husband and child for emergency leave and theonly airline that had flights open from Seattle,Washington to Detroit,Michigan was you gueseed it America West... So here goes my horror tale of the airline that has no heart.... At first I though, &quot;Yeah, ok this will be like the rest of my flights.&quot; YA RIGHT!!! At the airport we had problems getting on the flight because we almost forgot to brng proof of age for our son and they barely let us pass on a shot record . (Which is legitimate with all other airlines) Then we were forced to move because a man next to me had a problem being seated next to a &quot;young kid&quot;. Instead of asking that one man to move my husband and I had to pick up all of our things and be seated next to no one in the back ! We had felt humiliated. We did have a nice flight attendant or two but in the mass majority they were not nice. My son was a lap child and they didn't even want to give him his own cup of water! Water of all things. If that weren't enough the safety precautions in pre-flight were very vague and when I tried to ask a question about the oxygen masks I was shunned. Didn't these people get in to customer service classes? The captain was very polite on what turned out to be a very bumpy ride but the best part of the flight was when it was annouced over the loud speaker that &quot; We have now arrived in Detroit Michigan.&quot; I don't even know who moved out of their seats quicker me or the other alienated passengers . I highly recommend Southwest , Northwest, and United Airlines. Anything is better than feeling like a prisoner not a passanger."
234016;My one encounter with America West airlines will be my last. Last summer my husband and I were returning to Denver from Las Vegas after getting married and having a great time there. We had arrived on another airline and were leaving on a late evening flight with America West. We arrived on time to the airport and as soon as we reached our gate it was announced that our flight would be delayed by at least 2 hours due to a mechanical problem that needed checking. They then announced that another America West flight to Denver was taking off very soon and a few of us would be able to get on that flight. Of course, everyone stampeded down there and waited anxiously for our names to be called as one of the lucky ones. It took over an hour of waiting on the floor while they loaded the regular passengers and then started calling names. My husband and I were one of the lucky ones and boarded the plane. After what seemed like forever they announced that we would not be taking off for an least an hour due to the need to check on a sudden mechanical problem with this plane. We were told we could sit there or go wander the airport for an hour. I know this seems almost too unbelievable to be true, but it is. Most of us decided to get off. Once we were off and sitting back on the crowded floor the news somehow spread that the people who's names had not been called had gone back to the original gate to wait it out only to find that our original plane decided to take off after all. There were a lot of furious people let me tell you. Now here we were sitting there while the plane we were supposed to be on had left without us. No sooner had we heard this than it was announced that this second plane was going to leave after all as well. They had obviously decided that the mechanical problems weren't worth checking out on either one of the planes after all. This was not comforting to say the least and they never did explain to us what the problems had been. They started boarding us all over again and of course, by this time half of us could no longer find our boarding passes because we had tossed them after boarding the first time, so that mess had to be sorted out. This plane was now very crowded and those of us not originally assigned to this plane had to make do with a seat anywhere we could find it. My husband was new to flying and was very nervous about it. Couples were walking up and down the isle trying to find seats together, but the flight attendants barked rudely at us to just sit down and be grateful we were on the flight at all. This was extremely rude considering that the problem was caused by them in the first place, and I also felt that this flight was at a greater risk of crashing because of the unchecked mechanical problems they had chosen to ignore. I at least wanted to be able to die sitting next to my new husband. This was the most bumpy, terrifying flight I'd ever been on. The plane kept making strange noises and I know many of us were praying the whole way. When it came time to land the plane would begin to descend into Denver and suddenly go upwards again and circle around. The plane did this over and over again as if there were some problem that made the landing potentially dangerous. I'd never experienced this on a flight before. By the time we hit the ground I was just thankful to be back in one piece. There was never an apology or any explanations for what we all went through. Only rudeness and condecention as if we passengers were an inconvienience to them. I will never use America West again even if it means changing my entire trip plans to avoid it.
236912;"I've flown most of the major carriers in recent years, as my job requires travel to various locations across the globe. However, I have never had an experience worth writing about until now. At the end of August, my company sent me to do some work down in Aruba. (Can't complain, that was just too cool!) However, this was around the time that Florida was about to get hit by one of it's major hurricanes, and I was routed into Miami on American Airlines. Since Miami was kind of in the path of the hurricane, and I was worried about delays and cancelled flights, I spoke to the travel agent and she rerouted me to Newark on America's Worst, at an additional cost of 1100 dollars. I wish, I wish, I wish I had just stuck with the original flight. It was probably the biggest waste of money ever. I was scheduled to fly from Aruba to Newark and switch planes there to America's Worst flying to Las Vegas and then on to Reno. This flight was supposed to get me home that night, by midnight, as opposed to the Miami flight that would have gotten me home the following morning. We spent 1100 bucks so I could fly home 12 hours earlier. Instead...Let me take you on this tour of hell... shall we embark? Once I arrived in Newark, I had 1 hour to catch my plane. (If you've ever flown international to Newark, you have to go through security again and pray you have a long enough layover to make your flight.) I first asked an America West Representative where I needed to go to check in, or get my ticket. He pointed me to a dishearteningly long line. From there, I waited for 25 minutes and when I arrived at the front of the line, I was advised I was in the wrong line and I had better hurry to get to the right line. I ran (not an easy task for someone who weighs 250 dragging 2 suitcases and a duffel that weigh almost as much) across the building, to the tram and then from the tram up a flight of stairs with a carry on in tow, across another very long building, to the end of the row of windows into another impossibly long line. Another 15 minutes later, I finally was able to check into my flight. While at the counter, I asked the customer service reps if there was in-flight movie. Wahoo! There was! (Raising Helen was the cinematic treat) I asked if my headphones from Continental would work. After a quick inspection, I was reassured that they would, which meant I didn't have to find an ATM with my already tight deadline to get some extra cash for another pair of headphones on this flight. I received my boarding pass, checked my heavy bags and sprinted to security, where thankfully, the screening was very quick. I made it to my gate, just in time... to find out my flight had been delayed for 40 minutes (something that had not been mentioned to me 10 minutes prior when I checked in.) I watched as other angry, disgruntled or weary passengers queried the smug and uncooperative gate agents to find out what was going on, when we could expect to leave, were there other seats available, etc. Surprisingly, all seats were filled, so people were being turned away at the gate, and others were being asked to give up their seats. Finally, they started boarding the plane and once I was on, I found I was seated next to a very ill pregnant woman, and a man who could have easily been a linebacker and a half for an NFL team. Being no string bean myself, the three of us were packed into that row, with very little room to move, much less breathe. The seats were very uncomfortable, and there was no chance of getting the seatbelt fastened, with all of us squished in like sardines. I pulled out my Continental Headphones, ready to settle back and wait for the movie, when to my horror, the armrest had a dual prong hole for headphones! Yikes! My Continental ones, only had one little thingy. Sadly, they did not, after all, work with this equipment, like I had been reassured that they would. Additionally, because I had been told that they WOULD work, I didn't get any additional cash while in the airport to ""rent"" a set from the flight attendants later. So I was sitting there with $4.00, scrounged from my purse (at the discomfort of the 2 people sitting beside me, because I had to actually MOVE) praying that this would cover the cost of the headphones. Oh.. yes... The flight took off an hour and a half later than advertised, and once in the air, the flight attendant offered the RENTAL of these cheaply made headphones for 5.00. Drat! I begged her for the chance to just borrow them for the movie, I would give her the additional dollar at the gate, give her my firstborn, Heck, I'd even give my company laptop for collateral! She responded by making a small scene, that ""SHE"" had been entrusted by the airline and was completely responsible for these headphones, as if they were Faberge eggs, and couldn't make even that exception. (Ok. Tell me how this works- they rent the headphones to passengers, so they are reused every flight. They collect 5 bucks a pop, which is more than those cheap plastic pieces of &!&#^ are worth to begin with...Since they're trying to profit, wouldn't collecting $4 for a dollar store quality pair of headphones over a 6 hour flight be a better business decision than not loaning them at all, and shoving em back in their ""used headphones compartment""? Guess not.) Not only did she lecture me as if I had asked her- a complete stranger- to borrow a million dollars, but she did so with a raised voice, that caused other passengers to look over at me as the source of the commotion. Ok. Moving on now. We had been in the air for 15 minutes, and I was already furious. I had another 5 hours and 45 minutes of flight time left, with NOTHING to do. Using the laptop would have been a feat of contortionism and wasn't possible. I didn't have the foresight to grab a book out of my luggage (not that I could have read it anyways between the turbulence and inability to move my arms) since I had been looking forward to the movie, so I was stuck, staring at the back of the headrest in front of me, slowly going insane. The poor, ill pregnant girl beside me rings the bell and asks for a pillow and blanket. The flight attendant comes to her call and cheerfully brings her a pillow and blanket. I thought ""what a good idea! I could sleep!"" and I asked her for one as well. She gave me a rather nasty look, obviously still miffed that I would have questioned her integrity by asking to borrow a pair of cheap headphones for one dollar less than the rental price, and then advised me that there were none left. She didn't even look. Then she walked away. After about 30 minutes, my legs began cramping. I tried to shift in my seat, but this is a process. Any of you who have ever impersonated a sardine will understand. I tried to adjust my position, a few milimeters at a time, but was largely unsuccessful, due to the lack of knee space with the seat in front of me, or the ability to move sideways with the linebacker's legs pressing against mine (and not in a good way) from one side, and the pregnant girls' behind pushing against me from the other. Then, drink service began. I sat there, with my eyes closed, quietly praying for some miracle that time would speed up and when I opened my eyes, we'd be in Vegas, and I could switch planes. That was a mistake, because when the flight attendant came by, she reached across me and woke the pregnant girl to offer her a beverage, she offered the linebacker a beverage, but she completely ignored me. I am not joking here. Not that I would have been able to move enough to actually hold a cup, but I was not offered my ""complimentary beverage or snack"". (that we paid an extra 1100 for!!!) From that point on, I was furious. However, I sat there, a headache growing, my blood pressure rising, and just kept my mouth closed, my eyes closed and envisioned the island paradise I had just left.... UNTIL....the 21 year old (who was going to Vegas for her 21st birthday) across the aisle from me decided to begin a conversation with someone several rows back from me- FROM HER SEAT. She yelled back and forth to this guy (who happened to be going to Vegas with his buddies for a Bachelor party), flirting and trying to hook up. Being held prisoner in that uncomfortably tiny chair, and being forced to listen to her voice (which was something like a cross between Freddy Krueger's nails on a chalkboard and someone rubbing a balloon-kind of irritating) for quite awhile. Finally, the pregnant girl, who could actually move, having a window seat and all...rang for the Flight Attendant who was there immediately, and asked her to have the girl quiet down. The flight attendant, sweet as sugar, said she would take care of it and offered the pregnant girl some crackers and 7-up. She then went over to the loud girl and asked her to be quiet. (Several passengers nearby applauded). For the next hour, it was relatively quiet, then the noisy girl got bored and started whining loudly to her friends about how there was nothing to do in Vegas, gossiping about people they knew.. you get the picture. NOTHING BUT NOISE. After 20 minutes of this, I rang the bell for the flight attendant, but got no response. 5 minutes later, the pregnant girl rang her bell and there she was- Miss Flight Attendant of the year, ready to help. The pregnant girl stated she was ""6 months pregnant and sick and was trying to get some sleep but that girl is so loud, could you please move me elsewhere?"" The flight attendant responded that there were no empty seats, and that the loud girl did have the right to talk to her friends, since she wasn't shouting across the plane, but she would ask her to keep it down (there was a kind of shocked hush from the passengers nearby who heard this). The loud girl just moved to the back of the plane after the flight attendant spoke to her. (I guess she's hooking up with the guys from the Bachelor party after they land...) Anyways, fast forward another 3 hours to the end of the flight. (Most of the last 3 hours was filled with more leg cramping, headache, and loud annoying voices) We finally arrive at the gate in Vegas, just 30 minutes before my flight home is supposed to leave. (YAY!.. but wait... you knew it couldn't end happily.) I listened as the flight attendant from hell (IMHO) called out the gates for connecting flights. Wait... I didn't hear her mention Reno... uh.oh. We disembark and I go immediately to the counter and ask where my flight is supposed to leave from, or do I need to wait here for the plane to just move on. Oops. The gate attendant tells me that there's been a problem with my flight to Reno, and that I need to go to the main ticket counter to be ""redirected"". I look down, and my ankles have swollen to the point where I can no longer wear my shoes. I remove my shoes and walk down to the ticket counter in my socks. I had several looks of sympathy as I hobbled my way downstairs. When I arrived at the ticket counter, pandemonium and disorganization were 2 words that could describe what I found. There were 4 lines. None of which were marked with any kind of instruction as to who goes where. There were 8 to 10 visible customer service reps, who appeared to be ignoring the complaints of customers and were completely unsympathetic, and obviously oblivious to the fact that the more than 75 people who stood in front of them needing assistance had absolutely no idea where to go. I stood in the shortest line and watched as the people in front of me who said they had been waiting for half an hour prior to my arrival were called up very slowly, and then told they were standing in the wrong line- please go stand at the end of the line over there, behind those 50 people. Needless to say, this did nothing for the tired and angry people who had to wait another hour and a half for HELP, just to step to the person at the next window at the end of their long wait. There were 2 identifiable managers on duty, and neither of them, nor any of the other reps, made any attempt in the hour and a half that I stood in line, to tell people where they needed to be in order to be helped. A majority of the people were there because their flight had been cancelled for ""maintenance"" reasons. (A nice little fact that might have been nice to know back in New Jersey!!!!!!!!!!) By the time I reached the counter, I had no patience. I could barely stand, as my ankles had disappeared and it looked like my feet grew directly into my calves. In fact, it looked almost like my feet had been overinflated.. but anyways. I told the girl at the counter, I did not care what they had to do, I wanted to go home tonight. I told her that I had paid an extra 1100 dollars to get home tonight,and I wanted to get home tonight, even if I had to rent a car to drive home. (that of course, was refused). Instead, absolutely unsympathetically, and completely ignoring my problem, my pain, my frustration, aggravation, and of course, the mess around me, the people behind me with the same situation (but who were lucky enough NOT to have swollen ankles) she processed me onto a Southwest flight that left at 9:30 am, and gave me a 5 dollar voucher for breakfast. (Doesn't a milk at the airport cost 5 bucks???) She also gave me a voucher for a discount with a future flight (and actually made the comment ""not that you will ever fly with us again, but in case you change your mind"" of a whopping 50 dollars off. They set me up at a local hotel, who thankfully had MUCH better customer service, and advised me to go collect my luggage. WHAT?!?!?! Ok. I had been travelling for 19 hours already. I could barely walk. And now they expected me to go and claim my suitcases, which were quite heavy, just to drag them to a hotel, and back again in the morning when I changed flights. I went down to the baggage manager, and asked what would happen if I hadn't been told to come get the luggage, would it go through anyways? She was the only person that night that worked for the airline, who had any compassion and told me just to go ahead and wait for the hotel shuttle (with the 60 other people waiting for the 1 13-seat van- right.) and that my bags would make it to Reno eventually. (I didn't care when they got there, as long as they eventually did.) From here on out, my journey with America West ends. THANK GOD!!!! (It could have been worse... while I was at the counter, getting ""redirected"" contemplating offering to perform THEIR job for them and offer the poor hoardes behind me some direction where to go- I overheard another rep asking the manager what to do with a gentleman who was trying to get to San Diego. He had apparently flown in the previous night into Vegas, his flight had been cancelled for ""maintenance reasons"" then, and they had ""redirected"" him to Phoenix, and then somewhere else in California, then he had ended up back in Vegas due to flight problems in one of those cities. His Flight to San Diego AGAIN was cancelled -through no fault of his own- The manager actually had the audacity to say that they were NOT going to cover his hotel room for a second night, because THEIR AIRLINE had kept sending him from place to place to place and cancelling his flight home.) So... let's recap. Price- Oh My God that's ridiculously overinflated. 1100 bucks for a flight from Newark to Reno that never made it to Reno. Reliability- Let's see. Delay in leaving Newark. Cancelled flight to Reno that no one bothered to tell me about until I had been standing in line forever. Misinformed more times than I can count. Service- None. Well. That's being awfully nice. The service was the worst I have ever had anywhere. It doesn't exist. It's ANTI- CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! RUN AWAY!!!!! Avoid it!!! Unless you have a fetish for misery and frustration. Drink Service- Since I didn't get any... Can't really say. In flight accommodations- Well. Crowded seats. Stuffy, hot air. Loud voices. The lack of compassion of the staff. NO PILLOWS OR BLANKET!! NO HEADPHONES FOR THE MOVIE!!! NO LEG ROOM!!! NO ROOM TO MOVE!!! (I guess it's a good thing I didn't get a drink, because I wouldn't have been able to go to the bathroom.) Would I ever fly this airline again? Yeah, you're a real comedian. That's a good one. If you hate your in-laws, and don't want them to visit too frequently- this is the airline to book them on."
237483;With hubs in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Columbus this airline has a hard time competing with other airlines. Their main emphasis is price. Going from Seattle to LA for $180 RT is a good deal to me. If you go to Vegas you'll see that America West offers one of the lowest fares to and from Vegas since it is one of their hubs. Another nice thing that I liked about America West was their site. Easy to navigate and with many specials, it is a good way to purchase tickets online. Now let me tell you about what went wrong during my trip. When departing from Seattle to Las Vegas and then catching a connecting flight from Las Vegas to LA, I had no problems. Employees seemed to be nice and knowledgable, very courteous. The flight departed on time and arrived to LA on time. During the flight attendants were helpful and courteous. Flight crew did not talk much about the weather or any landmarks or temperature outside or in the cabin. I really liked the aircraft: A nice Airbus A-319 with nice TV screens and radio. I really like Airbus as opposed to a lowly Boeing. Traveling back to Seattle was my worst nightmare. Upon arrival to Los Angeles Intl Airport I recieved my tickets. About an hour before departure they told me the connecting flight from Las Vegas to Seattle was cancelled. Cancelled?!! From there, everything went wrong. The employees had no idea of what was going on. It happened that the flight was cancelled well before they gave me tickets. Why did they give me tickets an hour before then??? It took about an hour and a half to find another flight that they could me on, it ended up to be an Alaska Airlines flight that was only the following morning. America West had to provide me with a hotel and food until then. They gave me a coupon for $5 in airport for food which if you ever ate in airport buffets is not enough to get anything. Just about every little sandwich starts around $10. The hotel they chose was Ramada. Now the name may sound good but the hotel ended up to be a disaster. If you want to read about Ramada please read my review on that. I waited for their shuttle bus for two hours. Upon arrival to the airport the next morning Alaska Airlines put me on a stand by flight which I strongly protested. I think I should've been given a regular reserved seat for my fully paid ticket. Alaska Airlines finally agreed to give me a regular seat. That was the end of my experience with America West. If you find a special with this airline go ahead and try it. I think they either do a very good job or a very bad job. Their rating in consumer reports magazine has gone down dramatically since 1994.
244012;"America West Airlines has a lot to be desired. I have had the misfortune to be forced to fly America West on three different occasions, well at least had a seat on three of their flights. Two of their flights ended up being cancelled and the other flight I wished it had been cancelled. The two cancellations were the result of faulty equipment, as we were told. Both times I had a very hard time getting on another airline to get to where I was going. American Airlines did very well by sending a representative over to help people going to Pheonix, where I was going, and so was able to get to Pheonix three hours late. The other cancellation I ended up with United Airlines and arrived about 6hrs late. Even when I did fly America West the service was not as you would expect as on any other airline. Seems they had only Pepsi to drink and had only saltine crackers for a snack. No one welcomed you onto the plane, no one apologized for the inconvenience, and no one said &quot;have a nice day&quot; or &quot;we hope you enjoyed your flight&quot; when leaving. As they say you learn from experience, and I will say I have learned not to fly America West based on my experience."
248969;America west is a pretty good airline.I had the opportunity the fly on this airline on two different occassions.I flew from Atlanta,Georgia to Las Vegas,Nev.My flight was most enjoyable.It was a smooth trip all the way.The staff went out of their way to be pleasant and courteous.From the gate to the destination I was thouroughly satisfied.As we approached the Las vegas area the pilot Pointed out the hoover dam and even dipped the plane gradually so we could get a view from the air.The crew was always polite and asked several times if we needed anything during the flight.The flight arrived ontime.The return trip to Atlanta was just as good.If the fare is right I would fly on america west anytime I got the chance.They also offer a lot of good vacation packages.Go ahead and try the airline you will be surprised.
250840;"Hi All.... Well we just returned from a wonderful trip in Maui only to find that two of the three bags we had checked are missing in action AGAIN !!! It all started on line in Maui when we were checking in....one hour prior to departure....unfortunately Aloha Airlines are so unorganized we sat on line for almost 40 minutes before reaching an agent who then told us that we had checked in late and our luggage &quot;may not&quot; make it with us..... There was a flight leaving Maui 30 min after us and we were assured it would be on that flight which still had PLENTY of time to make the connection in Honolulu... Needless to say....we arrived home and only 1 of our bags showed up... We were flying Aloha from Maui to Honolulu then Continental from Honolulu to L.A....then America West from L.A. to Phoenix..... America West is having a lot of trouble trying to locate our bags now which is totally in line with everything they do......this is not the first time they've misplaced our luggage... However the real problem now is they are telling us that because we &quot;checked in late&quot; we may not be entitled to reimbursement for the first 3 days (which they normally allow $25/day for emergency items) ...they certainly have not heard the last from me.... Their baggage handling leaves alot to be desired and their customer service is even worse... A word to the wise....check in VERY early if you hope to see your bags on the other end... Good luck all..."
263479;"I used to live in Columbus, Oh, and when I traveled to and from that city I used to fly America West as they consistently had the lowest online fares. I had never really even heard of them before I booked my first flight. It turned out to be a great experience. It was on America West when I first experienced the &quot;baggie&quot; deli style lunch. You know, where you pick up your bagged lunch as you are entering the plane. I originally thought that this was just an America West invention, but later I found out that other airlines do this. Personally, I really like this meal option. The bags usually come with good stuff, and you can eat whenever you feel like it. The other thing that I remember about America West were the spotless aircraft interiors. There's nothing worse than entering a plane, only to find trash all over the place. Once, while flying Iberian Airlines, I found a half eaten chicken in the seat pocket in front of my seat. Yuck! America West planes are clean! America West is highly recommended!"
267684;Unless you really don't want to get where you're going in any sort of timely manner, I would avoid American West Airlines. Sure, the email deals they send out are very tempting, but over and over they have proven to me (and friends and family) that they don't know how to run an airline, period. After having my flight home canceled on one occasion, at the hotel I was put up in in Phoenix (one plus-they paid for it) the attendant at the desk told me that American West paid their hotel thousands of dollars each week to house stranded travelers. Maybe this is standard but it seems ridiculous. Someone at American West needs to admit that things aren't the way they should be, and attempt an overhaul. Use Southwest instead.
269109;If you fly into Las Vegas regularly, you better be in a gambling mood. Not just because of the illicit lure of the casinos, but also unholy crapshoot that is America West Airlines. To be fair, I fly Northwest Airlines the most, and so, only have limited experience with America West Airlines. But the times I have been on AWA, I've learned two things: You can never be too early and you can never count on anything. The last time I flew AWA was a classic example: I arrived at McCarran airport a solid two hours before my 10 a.m. flight, but the counters were so mismanaged and backed up, I missed my flight! It was truly a thing to behold. There were at least 200 people in line. As an experienced air traveler, I could see what the problem was: There were 16 slots open at the counter, but there were only eight people staffing them. As the counter got backed up rescheduling those who were missing planes, it became impossible for the few counter people they had to keep up. Part of the problem also lies in the way they schedule their flights. They try to check in folks in flights that are only scheduled to be five minutes apart. This only adds to the mayhem at the counter. If this was an isolated incident, I could excuse it. But it's happened more than once.
269192;"I've been flying America West on a monthly basis since November 1999. I chose them because they had fantastic airfare from Detroit to Ontario, CA, Burbank, Orange County, and LAX. By booking online and having a flexible schedule I was able to get roundtrip flights in the $220.00 to $260.00 price range. Although my latest search for a bargain airfare has brought up prices in the $390.00 to $410.00 price range. Hmmm...? A recent search on Delta for the same dates and a more desirable time range has brought me to a round trip fare for $220.00. Booking online has been reliable and hassle free for me. Although it would be alot easier if I could view all the flight fares without having to pick specific flights before hand. Their weekly specials are spectacular (Burbank to Phoenix only $68.00 RT), although scarce if you're departing from Detroit. One out of seven of my flights have been on time. I've found that take-offs can be anywhere from ten minutes to thirty minutes late. Sometimes the time can be made up while in flight. Occasionally the flight will be even later if there's weather interference. Since there's no direct flights for me I usually end up with a plane change in Phoenix (once in Vegas). Because my plane is almost always late in arriving in Phoenix, there is never a lay over so to speak. Some people may find this a delight. Although I do not! There is only a half hour to forty five minute time frame for me to catch the next plane before take off. Which is very difficult to do when your arriving flight is late. Most recently the supposedly helpful gate attendant in Phoenix told me &quot;you'd better hussle&quot; if I wanted to catch my next flight! So that's what I did, from gate B-6 to A-3, which is a hike. When I arrived at gate A-3 I discover that my connecting flight is delayed by forty five minutes. It would've been much less stressful for me if there were no gate attendant. In which case I would have relied on the informative flight schedules which are on the monitors throughout the airport. The beverage/snack service is adequate. The meals however are unappealing. Most recently I was served a meatloaf sandwich on a rye bun which had the foil wrapping burnt to the sandwich. The salad was very fresh though. So if you're going to be flying during your meal time, I'd highly suggest bringing your own sandwiches, etc.. and salvage what you can off the inflight meal. Lastly, I'd like to offer you a few tips if you feel compelled to choose this airline. Be sure you check your arrival/depart info. once you get to the airport. Try to get an aisle seat and don't rush to get on the plane. Unless of course you enjoy sitting on a packed plane before you have to. And chances are you're going to be late in taking off. I usually sit at the gate and wait until everyone else gets on. Otherwise they'll be tripping all over you while they load up their massive carry ons. Bring one carry on and stow it under your seat. It's not likely that I'll be flying with them this summer. Delta has better rates for my destination and I find their service much more reliable and professional."
271126;"I fly a few times a year for pleasure. I traveled from Philadelphia to Las Vegas in September. First, I must admit I used the airline that previous April with no problem. Back to September...First of all, the flight was delayed in Philadelphia for almost 2 hours. Coming home was a different story. I had a connection in Phoenix. I requested wheelchair service because I have a disability and sometimes required one from time to time. I called the day before my flight, it was marked in the computer, yet when I arrived there was no wheelchair. I inquired about it and got no service. Just an ""oh well, sorry"" Unfortunately, I can't talk further about this because I have an attorney. Also, I asked for an upgrade and they couldn't accommodate me, even though when I got on the plane, there was an empty seat in first class. The plane arrived safely and I guess that can be good enough to some people but, I was in pain because of not getting the service I needed"
283151;"Ok, before we begin, on my last trip to Arizona..this airline charged me $50.00 for going 5 pounds over the pound limit AND UNLIKE other airlines, did not offer me the chance to stuff my things in another bag (coincidentally i did have a duffel bag in my suitcase). They never explained that it was 50 pounds a bag...HMPPH. That being said I have flown this airline 4-5 times and each times there were delays. The planes have never taken off on time from my arrival city. For some reason, they have managed to leave on time from NYC, which is odd in itself. New York is known to have extremely long delays at the airports. One of the problems is the Las Vegas airport (which i often fly to with America West) was working on its runway at the time. So not all of these problems are America West's, but still they do not seem to have any ""pull"" with the individual airports as other airlines do. The planes and seats on AWA's planes also seem very outdated and old. Seats do not move back all the time (malfunctioning), cushioning is warn and the aisles are very cramped. IT seems they have jammed an extra row or two into their airplane (I realize all airplanes seem like this, but for some reason it seems worse with America West). Frequent flyers who use this airline for business have continually complained about this airline. Delays, unhappy staff on the ground (as I encountered) and an ovaerall lousy experience seems to be the norm. Maybe NYers like myself just like to complain, but I have had much more satisfactory flights with airlines in Bankruptcy (like American) than with the liquid America West. They have now begun to sell overpriced food on their flights, adding to the anger of passengers ( I must admit the food, which I happily bought, is expensive but tasty). The staff of the airline is actually nice, they seem to appreciate that you are being treated by cattle and try to make the best of the bad situation. Also, the fellow passengers on America West seem to be in a perpetual bad mood, which may or may not be related to the airline they are flying. All in all, if you can, find another airline, even if you need to spend a bit more."
285746;I fly a lot. And I cant STAND this airline. While there isn't really a great choice of airlines today, this one has got to be the worst. I have flown them three or four different times this year alone, and each experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't bore you with all of the details but here are a couple of reason they are on my S**t list: 1) Seats are jammed together so that legroom is a scarce commodity. 2) If you are travelling with others, often the seats aren't together. There were numerous folks on my flights complaining about this. 3) Not-so-friendly gate agents 4) Even more not-so-friendly flight attendants. I can't count how many times they passed me by when my call light was lit, not to mention that I got scolded for using the toilet. 5) I don't recall leaving on time for most trips. Unfortunately, I have accrued quite a few frequent flier miles with them, and I now have to frequently travel to Phoenix which is their hub so I anticipate I will be forced to use them, BUT if you have a choice, I would opt for someone else...like Southwest. Oh, one last thing... 6) Their website is terrible. With most airline or travel websites that I use, you select your destination and date and you are offered itinerary choices complete with prices. America West's site is not only difficult to navigate and slow, but you only offered flight options without prices. You have to select flights in numerous combinations in order to find the best fare. Frustrating to say the least!
285765;I have flown several times over the course of my life with several different airlines. I have found one airline to be the worst (by far) over years. That airline is America West. Every single time I fly with them, there is some sort of a problem. Whether it is a delay as a result of plane problems, an outright cancellation, or overbooking, my flights with America West have never gone off smoothly. One of the first problems with America West in my area of the country (Houston) is that most flights must go through Phoenix. Now, I understand when flying to Las Vegas, it does make sense. And, I also realize that Phoenix serves as the West Coast hub for America West. However, it seems like delays are par for the course in Phoenix, at least with America West. Plenty other times I have flown Southwest and have had no problem with delays. This leads me to believe that America West is the culprit, not the airport. I do understand that maintenance and weather are always an issue when it comes to flying. I get upset when either one causes problems, but I do understand. I don?t want to fly when it?s unsafe. I think the problem with America West is with their service when a problem arises. The first time I ever flew America West was about five years ago. I was flying with a large group of friends to Las Vegas. The weather was fine, yet flights were being delayed left and right. There was absolutely no movement in the check in line and any attempts to get any information resulted in, ?please wait in line.? Finally, after about two hours in line and our flight being cancelled, we are told, ?Don?t worry, we have another plane on the way.? We figure at the most it will take a couple of hours to get the other plane. Wrong! It took almost four hours for us to secure another flight. All this time, we asked to be placed on a competitor (with us making up the difference) and they just refused saying the plane was ?just about ready.? My most recent trip also resulted in some extremely poor service. I arrived and the Las Vegas airport about an hour and a half early. This is actually thirty minutes sooner than they even recommend. And, considering the luck I was having that trip, they are lucky I even made the flight (I was hot). Anyway, I was told previously that my ticket would allow me to skip the check in line and head straight for the gate. I only have one small bag so I didn?t have any luggage to check. I arrive at my gate. At least, I assume it was the correct gate. While, the television monitors indicated I was at the correct gate, the signs around the gate were blank. There were approximately twenty people ahead of me and no personnel at the gate. Keep in mind this is about and hour and fifteen minutes ahead of the scheduled departure. No personnel even arrive at the gate until boarding is set to begin, about fifteen minutes before flight time. I couldn?t believe it. Where did these people get their boarding passes? Not in the line that I, along with forty other people, was standing in. Finally, about thirty minutes after the scheduled take off, I received a boarding pass. Keep in mind, there was no assigned seat and there was never an announcement made. I guess I should have been happy. I wasn?t. I realize that these two incidents are isolated and I may have just experienced some of the worse that America West has to offer. I will say that the flight attendants were pleasant the food provided was pretty good. On the short legs of trips, you are only provided with ?cracker snacks? and limited beverage service. America West is a Pepsi airline and there is no Dr. Pepper on short trips. That fact alone sours me to the airline. The meals are actually pretty good compared to other airlines. I had a tasty little chicken sandwich on one of my longer trips. The airplane is comfortable with no special attributes. Some of the longer flights do have movies and television shows as well as music. All you have to do is rent the headphones for a nominal fee. The rates on fares are also pretty competitive. Truthfully, the main reason I have flown America West recently has been because of the cheaper fares. I figure you do have to give up a little bit of service for the price you?re paying, but not as much as American West gives up. I will say one positive thing about America West. I received my frequent flyer credits on my Continental statement very quickly. The airlines are partners and America West miles do transfer over to the Continental OnePass program. That is a great thing as I fly Continental more than any other airline. Overall, I would not recommend flying America West. The fares are pretty low at times and that might persuade you to fly with them. Don?t do it. Trust me. You will be sorely disappointed in the service and the problems that arise will make your trip less enjoyable.
287103;"Here's a happy little story (read sarcasm) of one girl trying to travel by air. Living in Phoenix, the most flights are available on Southwest or America West. I like Southwest but sometimes having 3-4 stops going from Phoenix to the east coast can get tiresome. So I thought I'd try America West. The first time I tried it, it was a non-stop from Phoenix to Baltimore. The plane was delayed with no explanation and any time I tried to see what was going on, I got yelled at. I understand the attendants are tired of dealing with customers, but it's their job! Even if they don't know anything, they should tell us they don't know and give us an approximate time of when they might know something. Here is a basic dialogue between me and the gate attendant... Me: Do you have any idea why the plane's late and when it might be here?&quot; Her: No. Me: Is there anything you can tell me? Her: (nasty look) No. Me: Is there anyone who could tell me anything? Her: (loud voice) The plane's late, that's the story. (Then she walked away) No one else seemed to be interested in the situation. I watched the gate and the monitors to see if there was any change. The gate number on the monitor changed twice in an hour. I went to both gates but the attendants there didn't know what was going on. Anyway, long story short (too late), the place was 2 hours late. Then once we got on the plane did we take off right away? NO! We sat on the ground, after all the people and luggage got on board, for another 45 minutes. The flight attendants didn't know why. Once we got off the ground, the flight was smooth and I eventually got to my destination. The flight home- the plane was an hour late, we sat on the plane on the ground for another hour, eventually took our flight and then circled around the final destination 3 times before landing. Once we landed, we drove around the airport for another 20 minutes, I guess looking for a gate. I could just picture the people in the airport waiting for that plane wondering when and at which gate was it going to wind up. Since that flight I have seen twice on the local news, unhappy people sitting around the airport waiting for America West flights. I have also heard from friends of mine that when they took America West, the flights were overbooked regularly. One friend has received 3 free flights from America West because they gave up their seats in an overbooking situation. Did I learn my lesson? No. I decided the first trip I took was bad luck and I would try America West again. This time it was a flight from Phoenix to San Francisco, a much shorter flight. This time, the flight was canceled. I asked when there would be another flight and no one knew. I checked the monitors and saw nothing. I called the airline (the people on the phone seem to be more helpful than the people at the airport) and they told me there was a flight leaving in 2 hours. So I waited and tried to get on that one. Of course, everyone from the canceled flight tried to get on that one. Well, I was one of the lucky few and actually got on the flight. There were 20 or so other people that did not get on that flight. I have no idea what they did. It would probably be faster for them to rent a car. This flight left only 15 minutes late!! The return trip was almost flawless. The plane boarded 20 minutes late and then we sat on the ground for an hour waiting for the wing to be inspected. This made me nervous. Why couldn't we have gotten on another plane and leave this one to be inspected? Well, I'm here, so obviously nothing happened to the wing in the flight. I arrived back home an hour and a half later than expected. Not bad! If you're traveling for business, don't use this airline. If you have an extra day or two to kill, maybe you could get a free flight for giving up your seat. Personally, I am NEVER taking an America West flight again!"
287355;"I know, I was asking for trouble. If you read my other epinion on America West, you'll know I've had nothing but problems with this airline. But they're the only ones that have options of travel times when flying out of Phoenix. I even could get a direct flight!!!!! So, I crossed my fingers and made the reservation. I was to leave at 1:12 PM(ever wonder why they have such specific times for departure and arrival? Why not just say between 12-2, that would be more realistic). Well, 5:00 AM, the morning I was to leave, I got a call from the airline telling me the flight was cancelled and I could take the 4 PM flight. I was more upset with the hour that they called (5 in the morning is NOT a good time to call people) than the news they gave me. Actually, the 4 PM flight worked out even better than the other one since it was a non-stop and I got to Boston an hour later (even with the 45 minute delay). The return flight also presented problems. First, they boarded us 45 minutes late even though the plane was at the gate. Then we sat on the plane at the gate for another hour while we waited for them to deal with &quot;mechanical problems&quot;. Of course people were getting nervous wondering whether or not this was a safe way to fly. After an hour they came on the PA and told us they were waiting to take care of the paper work and then we'd be on our way. 45 minutes later, we were still waiting. Finally, 3 hours after the intended departure, we were on the runway and FIRST IN LINE to take off!!!!! Because we were all so patient with the &quot;mechanical problems&quot; they gave us complimentary headsets so we could watch the in-flight movie (which was Bowfinger, by the way). Why does America West have so many flight cancellations? Well, the I was talking to one of the flight attendants while we were waiting for take-off. According to her, the airline doesn't carry forward employee's sick days to the next year so everyone has to use it up before the end of the year or they won't be compensated. So, with so many employees doing that, there isn't enough crew and the flights get cancelled. My question to her was, &quot;This makes some sense but wouldn't they know how many people they have for the crew at least a day before each flight?&quot; She didn't have an answer. OK, now I mean it. I am NEVER flying this airline again, no matter how convenient the situation looks!!!"
290129;"I'll be honest: I like no-frills. I like low fares. But I refuse to fly America West again, no matter HOW cheap they are. Its a pity - they used to be a really decent airline. I have had the dubious &quot;pleasure&quot; of flying America West for three trips in the past six months. Each time there was a delay, a rescheduling, a flight cancellation or a combination thereof. Not to mention, most of the planes were dirty - my tray table on several flights had remnants of food on them, and one one occasion I found a wad of used tissue in the seat-back pocket. Ewww. The commuter planes seemed to be the worst for this. My flight to Los Angeles on my first trip was delayed, and then, being seated in the front part of the plane, I was treated to an animated debate over whose flight calculations to use - the pilot's or the co-pilots. I have no idea who won the debate - I was unnerved sufficiently to ask to be moved to a seat in the rear of the plane. We made it, but were late, so I missed my connection. Fortunately, I managed to get another flight but it was then that I learned not to put too much stock in America West's schedule. On my 2nd trip, this time to Washington, DC, I made the flight to Los Angeles ok, but after running to make my connecting America West flight, I arrived (all out of breath) to find that the flight that I was scheduled to take to Las Vegas was cancelled. This time I lucked out - I was put on a direct flight to DC on Delta and I enjoyed every minute. On the return leg of this trip, I was treated to another delay. Apparently the flight crew had arrived 2 hours late the night before and by federal regulations needed more ground time. This I can understand - I really think its a GOOD thing to have well-rested pilots. I was rather miffed, however, that we didn't find out the real status of this flight for about 30 minutes - the gate agents either had no clue or just weren't telling. Judging by their attitudes, it was the latter. The flight crew finally arrived - 2 hours late - and we proceeded to board. Once aboard, we were sternly lectured, then yelled at, by the flight attendant, who thought we weren't getting seated fast enough to suit her. She must've had a hot date waiting for her on the other end. My final trip was just lovely. Upon checking in, I was informed that there was a problem with the flight. No details, just &quot;a problem&quot;. Minutes later, I hear from another passenger that the flight had been cancelled, but then reinstated. Then word came that while the flight was reinstated, it wasn't *really* that flight, it was one diverted from another route, and we could expect even more delay. Oh joy! Two hours later, we were in the air. The only saving grace was that the flight attendant, Reggie, went out of his way to make the flight pleasant. I had never heard of any flight attendant getting applause for the safety announcements, but Reggie did it so well and made it so interesting that not only was everyone's attention focused on him, but he made it entertaining *and* informative. We all applauded, and deservedly so. The man deserves a HUGE raise! (Reggie, if you're out there, well done - thank you!!) I have to give America West some credit - they obviously have excellent communication skills. I had a friend waiting for me at the airport in Phoenix, and she was concerned when I didn't show up. She talked with a gate agent, and was told that my flight hadn't gotten off the ground yet. Meanwhile, I am standing at the gate, just yards away, having just gotten off the flight that &quot;hadn't left yet&quot;. I went to inform this agent that the flight had, indeed, departed and was, in fact, at the gate a short walk away. The look on the man's face was priceless... The return leg of this trip was more of the same... delayed flight. This time they realized they had no flight attendant, so they had to call around and eventually woke one up. She arrived an hour later, but to her credit, she was smiling, friendly and everything a flight attendant should be. I spoke with several other passengers who have taken several flights with America West, and the consensus was &quot;never again&quot;. Apparently the airline is plagued with equipment and staffing problems, and until this is properly addressed, I'll just pay more and fly an airline who shows a little more concern for their paying passengers."
291481;I was terribly disappointed with the service I received from American Airlines. This summer, I was scheduled for a flight from Colorado Springs to Ontario California. Upon boarding the plane to fly out, some of the ground crew noticed a hydraulic leak from one of the landing gears. We were then forced to de-board the plane, where I proceeded to weight in the passenger terminal. After a 30 minute delay, the airline announced that a maintenance crew was on there way to assess the problem. After about another 30 minutes the airline stated that the plane was not going to make the flight. So, fair enough, these things happen. Unfortunately, they were not able to get me on another flight that day. I was afforded room accommodations and a meal in a nearby hotel. Again I think to myself, these things happen. The next morning, I arrive at my new rescheduled flight to come to find that the plane I was about to board had another mechanical problem. Now I was mad. Two mornings in a row! If the plane had flown, once, twice, or maybe three flights our departure time, I can understand! I was a aircraft mechanic in the Air Force for two years and I know that before an aircraft is put to bed after its last flight, a post flight/pre-flight inspection is conducted prior to the next flying day. Either these planes were hopelessly broken or the airline just didn't have their own crew. Now my travel plans have been delayed nearly 26 hours. Finally after another 2 hour delay, in day two of a trip that was to take one day, I was finally able to bored the plane and ACTUALLY depart the terminal. I don't think the delay I was forced to endure is reasonable by any means, and I would not recommend this airline to anyone.
291676;"These days the airline industry in general is being overtaxed and most airlines are struggling to keep up with demand. This causes many delays, cancellations, etc. but one airline stands out as worse than the rest, at least in my experience. That airline is America West (AM). I fly probably 3 to 5 times a year or so and I have flown on most domestic US airlines like United, Alaska, TWA, Delta, Southwest, Continental, etc... I have had bad flying experiences with many different airlines, who hasn't, but my experiences with America West have been for the most part negative. Let me spin out a few examples of my bad experiences. I was flying to Washington DC and I had to fly through Phoenix to Houston on the way on AM from Oakland. My flight was the first of the day out of Oakland. We had an hour delay getting out of Oakland because they couldn't get the engine started, the machine that helps start the engines was out for repair and the backup unit wasn't powerful enough! So they had to borrow one from another airline. When we finally got to Phoenix there was an hour delay sitting in the terminal. Then we finally get on the plane (which was sitting there all along). Now keep in mind it is July and we are sitting in a plane on the tarmac in Phoenix, its 110 degrees!!! We sit in the plane for 1.5 hours while they replace the radio antenna on the plane! Then we finally take off, about 2.5 hours late. From what I have heard America West doesn't have the best maintenance record. On another trip to Phoenix I was leaving Seattle and the gate attendant was yelling at everyone to check his or her bags so the plane would leave on time. When not enough people cooperated she went around to people sitting in the terminal and got people's bags. Have things got this bad that airlines have to force people to check their bags!? Well I guess when they are never on time people don't want to let their bags out of their site. Anyway I didn't appreciate that rude demanding treatment. Our flight home to Seattle was delayed due to a problem with the bathroom. Sitting in the Phoenix Airport it was amusing to see that over half of the AM flights were delayed and many people were less happy with the counter people. Then on the plane there was a lot of trash in the magazine pocket in front of my seat. You think they would at least pick up the trash after the last flight? Ok one positive for AM; there in-flight food is good for airline food. Now I am not just basing my epinion on my experiences but also based out what I have heard from Taxi drivers at the Phoenix Airport (America West?s' Hub) and friend who live in Phoenix who have a lot more experience with AM. Also in a survey I saw in a magazine somewhere it listed AM with the most customer complaints. So there it is, not much more to say. I recommend you avoid flying America West if you want to get somewhere on time and have good service."
303014;Give me a ticket for an aeroplane! While still recovering from knee surgery it became urgent that I get my care at another locale. I went online to Lowestfare.com, but I wasn?t happy with the amount of choices available. Not airlines, but prices. Being off work for any length of time makes you conscious of your bank balance. I then surfed over to Yahoo! Travel where I found a much larger variety of travel schedules at a wide variety of prices. America West Airlines had the lowest prices with the most convenient flight schedule. Fortunately the date leaving and the date returning both had open seats. I booked a flight right online. As I?m going through the different windows, entering my name, address, credit card number, I got to go to a screen that asked me to pick my seat! The screen displayed all of the seats available in the class you are flying (i.e.: coach, First Class.) Right after I picked my seat assignment, the next screen asked if I needed a wheelchair. I checked off the Yes button and submitted my request. The last screen has a ?Please Print This Page for Your Records?. Here was my trip itinerary, my trip ID, my flight schedules and information for Customer Service. That night there was an email with my confirmation number to use on the America West website. The Airport: I had someone to carry everything for me up to the check-in counter. Once there, as the clerk is checking in my bag, he notes that I?ve asked for a wheelchair and he notes that I?m to be pre-boarded on the flight! At this point I did request a different seat than the one assigned via computer because I wanted to be up front. There was no problem, he gave me a bulk-head seat that has a bit more leg room. I?m taken directly to my gate and all I have to do is wait for boarding. I was boarded first, and settled in to my seat. The rest of boarding happened routinely but a family was given the two aisle seats and one middle seat in the row I was in. Because I didn?t want to spend the whole flight next to a very active toddler, and I?m basically nice, I gave up my window seat, and took the other aisle seat that the Father had been assigned. This worked to my advantage because the Father was more than willing to get my small backpack that the flight attendant had put up in the overhead compartment at the end of the flight (the bulkhead seats have no underneath storage capabilities.) The Airbus Jet This particular model jet had 3 rows of four seats in First Class. The aisle separated each pair of seats. Coach contained 21 rows of six seats. The aisle separated each set of three seats. Legroom was minimal. Seat space was minimal. A small child had lots of room. I had adequate space to stretch my legs because I?m short and I was placed at the bulkhead. The Flight: The flight was 15 minutes delayed because the last couple on board had tickets in First Class, and they had Four Large Pieces of Luggage with them (there?s no way that those pieces would fit in the diagram that they show for carry on!) The flight attendants are making room anywhere they can for this large luggage. I felt sorry for the Coach passengers that normally stuff their stuff in the overheads near the front of Coach. That got emptied and stored elsewhere for this couple?s bags. We finally take off, are given the speech via small 8? video screens, and we?re on our way. In flight, we were served pretzels and soda no charge, I just had a bottled water. You did have the choice to pay $3 for beer and wine or $4 for other alcoholic beverages. Service was fast on this short flight. Just about the time they finished passing out the drink and pretzels, they came back through to pick up the trash. Then we were descending. The flight was fast and we ended up landing on schedule. Before the flight was over, the flight attendant offered to have a wheelchair waiting at the ramp. I was taken to baggage claim, got my luggage, and went out with my transportation to my final destination. Two Weeks Later: By this time all I need is a cane to get around with. I still get preferential treatment at the main ticket counter, I still get pre boarded, and the new flight crew is still taking very solicitous care of me. This flight coming back to SFO was oversold, so at first they were offering later flight passage and $200 vouchers for those who could change their flights, and then they upped it to $300 plus passage on a later flight. I had someone expecting me on the other side so I couldn?t take advantage of that. Darn! It all sorted itself out and this time the flight only left the gate five minutes after scheduled time. The same safety speech came on the video screens of the same type of Airbus Jet. I watched intently as I was shown how to use the dangling cup and where to stick my arms through the seat bottom. 10 minutes after take off, drinks and pretzels were once again passed out on this 90-minute flight. This flight we had a tour-guide type captain and the natural wonders of this great country were pointed out as we flew over them. I always enjoy that. Once again, the flight attendant asked if I needed a wheelchair at the end of the flight. Since I could manage with a cane, I declined. I had someone special waiting at the other end of my flight and he would take care of everything I needed. Recommendations: I?ve had to fly this airline many times in the past for work. Those trips were very stressful since I was usually told an hour before flight time that I was to be on the plane! I didn?t have the opportunity to enjoy the whole experience in a relaxed atmosphere (when you can?t walk, you go at someone else?s pace.) This flight ?both legs were fine. Not like flying First Class on Delta, but perfect for what I needed when I needed it at a price I was happy with. I would travel via America West Airline again, as often as I can. **Note: Round trip to between Western destinations was a total of $101.50 after tax, airport fee, and anything else they could think of**
305274;Nearly everything you read here about America West is true. I am a frequent flyer, and have found that by making minor adjustments to my travel schedule, I can avoid many travel issues that have plagued America West over the years. Unfortunately, our most recent trip to Puerto Vallarta wasn't without a delay. We departed Northern California with free tickets on an early morning flight, making a connection in Phoenix, which got us to our final destination ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, we were heading back in the evening, as there is only one flight a day back from PV. Our flight left on time, but we arrived in Phoenix to find an earlier cancelled flight, an overbooked airline and no crew. After a four hour delay, we finally made it home at 2am. Was I upset? You bet, but not surprised. I've come to expect this from America West, especially on Friday nights. The following are tips that may help when traveling with America West, but it's good to keep these in mind no mater what airline you travel with. 1. Travel as early in the morning as possible. I have found by doing so on America West, the majority of my flights are on time. All flights seem to connect through Phoenix, and delays generally occur later in the day. Evening connections seem to be the worse. I try to avoid late flights, but sometimes I can't. If you fly with America West in the evening, expect delays and cancelled flights. 2. Avoid Friday afternoons in Phoenix. I have never made a connection on time with America West on Friday afternoons in Phoenix. I've taken five rt flights thus far this year, averaging about 15 a year, through AW's hub, and make every effort to avoid Friday travel whenever possible. Afternoon and evening flights in general are bad, but Friday's seem to be worse. 3. Book flights at least 90 minutes to 2 hours apart. When connecting in Phoenix or elsewhere, especially on afternoon flights, having more time translates into making your flight, in the event your plane is late. America West is notorious for over-booking flights by 30 or more, counting on the fact that their flights will be delayed as the day wears on. When making your reservation, don't assume you will have lots of time between flights. That one hour connection time they give you can shrink to 10 minutes if your flight is delayed. Tell the agent to book you on an earlier flight, if possible. 4. Obtain seating assignments at the time you book your flight. You will be guaranteed a seat in the event the flight is over-booked. That still doesn't seem to be a firm guarantee, but it's the best you can hope for. Don't assume you have been assigned a seat when you reserve your flight. You must ask the booking agent for your seat assignment to be certain. Make sure you also get boarding passes for your connecting flights. At check-in they seem to do this automatically, but I always see people chasing down a plane with me who don't have one. 5. Prepare for the worse. Unfortunately, America West wouldn't be my first choice for air travel, but which carrier I go with on business isn't always up to me. If you find yourself traveling with America West, be patient, bring lots of reading material and remain calm if your flight gets delayed or cancelled. You will find America West assistance counters all over the airport in Phoenix. By the end of the day, these areas are packed with angry and frustrated travelers. If you find your self dealing with an insensitive, bitchy agent, that's why. I tend to avoid these areas and go down to the main check-in area to get re-routed if cancellations occur early in the day. I can't stress enough how important it is to book early morning flights on America West. 6. Letters. Complaints to America West, I'm told, seem to go unanswered, and I often wonder if anyone reads them at all. If you are writing to tell them how terrible they are, and how upset you are about your flight being cancelled, chances are you won't get anything more than a postcard acknowledging they received your letter. If on the other hand they lost or destroyed your luggage, you were denied boarding due to overbooking, and not compensated appropriately or directly experienced a problem more serious than an inconvenience, in my experience, America West will respond promptly and provided satisfactory compensation. You can write to Customer Relations at America West Airlines, 4000 East Sky Harbor Boulevard, Phoenix, AZ 85034. Would I recommend America West to friends and family? Probably not. But if you have to travel with them, do so early in the day, and you won't experience as many problems. Good luck!
310480;"I'm still recovering from my Thanksgiving holiday. That's why it's taken me a while to write this epinion. After all, we were going to see my in-laws (enough said) AND we were misguided enough to fly America West airlines for a long flight WITH our 5 month-old baby. Like I said, I'm still recovering. We decided to fly America West because it was the cheapest option between Las Vegas, Nevada and Spokane, Washington. Spokane is not exactly a MAJOR airline town, so economical flights into the airport are usuaully a rarity. My husband's family lives about 2 hours away from Spokane, in a tiny town of 2,000 people...so we were going to have to spring for a rental car too, and we wanted as cheap a flight as possible. America West's flights were significantly cheaper than those on Southwest, United, or Alaska Airlines. I now know why. First off, to fly to Washington state, we had to backtrack to Phoenix, Arizona, which is America West's &quot;hub&quot; airport. That added an extra hour to our flight time, but hey--if it saved us $200, okay. We were scheduled to fly out at 6:00 a.m., an ungodly hour, but even worse when you are packing around a 5 month-old. He did NOT appreciate being awakened at that hour, in fact he gave me a pretty impressive scowl that seemed to say, &quot;Hey--I'm supposed to wake YOU up, not the other way around lady!&quot; But, I digress. So here we are in the airport at 5:00 a.m., with a cranky baby, hauling a ton of luggage. (Packing for a baby and all.) There is no sky-cap at America West's outside check-in site, so we have to drag all the luggage in to a massive line. When we reach the check-in, a scarily cheery woman informs us in a chirping tone that, &quot;The 6:00 flight to Phoenix has been cancelled.&quot; Giggle, giggle. WHAT!!! Oh don't worry though, they'll rebook us! Trouble is, we NEEDED to get on the 6 a.m. flight, that's why I booked IT! We were now going to miss our connecting flight from Phoenix to Spokane. We were scheduled to arrive in Spokane at 10:30 a.m., where we were going to meet my college roommate for a few hours. I had not seen her in almost a year, and she had not met my son at all. At this point, I almost started crying right there in line, as I realized I wasn't going to get to see Michelle now, as the soonest they could get us into Spokane now was 4:00 p.m. It would already be dark by then, and we'd have to leave immediately to drive to my husband's home town. The tears were welling up in my eyes... Then the gate agent says, &quot;Oh--looks like that flight's full too. Maybe we can get you on a flight TONIGHT.&quot; Now my head starts spinning around on my shoulders. I think that scared the ticketing agent and she told me, &quot;Oh wait!&quot; (Nervous laughter.) &quot;We can put you in first class on the 4:00 flight.&quot; Fine. I leave growling, my husband is muttering, and my son is screaming. Yeah. Let's go sit in the airport for 3 hours. The airplane on the flight to Phoenix was awful. Even though we were flying with a baby, they placed us in the first row of coach, where you get NO underseat storage room. I asked to be moved so that I'd have a place to put our baby bag, and they said, &quot;Sorry. Too late, so sad, etc. etc.&quot; Luckily, a kind woman behind us offered to put it under her seat. The seats in coach have to be smaller than other airlines' seats. They were SO tiny, and even though I realize that my hips are a bit bigger than they were pre-baby, I've flown other airlines since my son has been born, and never been this cramped. In Phoenix, I thought we'd landed into a scene from Dante's _Inferno_. It was truly hellish. People were screaming, flights were canceled, gate agents were begging people to accept $100s of dollars to give up their holiday flights, etc. etc. I told my husband, if they offer money for our seat we're taking it! (Heck--they were offering $600 a seat, a flight later that day, AND free hotel, meals, and drinks for the day.) Of course, our flight didn't qualify. First class was a definite improvement on the second leg of our flight. I drank vast quantities of white wine and wiped my hands with cloth napkins. It almost wiped out the memory of my missed reunion with my best friend, and the hours in the airports with my cranky son, who now mercifully had fallen asleep in his father's lap. I'd like to say that our trip home was peaceful and nice, but it wasn't. More problems abounded with late flights. On the way back, I happened to witness some of the RUDEST exchanges between customers and America West's employees. The employees I saw were rude, snotty, and snippy to obviously harried people who only wanted what they'd paid for. It was truly frightening. As a side note, I used to fly America West quite a bit in the early 1990s. At that time, they were a friendly, suitably efficient airline. I don't know what has happened to them in the past decade, but I've already ripped up my frequent flyer card with America West. They are habitually late, rude to their customers, and offer poor service while in the air. I used to like to fly them because of their safety record, but now I keep reading repeated stories about how they are having maintenance problems, etc. If their mechanics have the same attitude as their customer service employees, then I'm not surprised. I actually feel sorry for people who have work for America West. It seems evident that there problems are related to poor management that has forgotten about the human touch in the quest for the almighty dollar."
312053;"In 2006, the redhead and I were passengers on AmericaWest Flight 163, from San Jose, CA, to Las Vegas, NV. About fifteen minutes before we were supposed to land, the redhead got up from her seat to use the lavatory. She went to the facilities at the back of the plane, on the port side. She locked the door of the lavatory upon entering: she knows the door was locked, because the light went on. This is not the first time she&#146s ever been on a plane. As a matter of fact, she&#146s been using commercial are travel for thirty years; she knows how to use the bathroom on a plane, and how to lock it. As she was sitting on the can, the door opened, and she looked up to see a creepy male steward in the doorway; she recognized his uniform, in particular. Stunned, she said nothing; he also was silent, then turned and left, closing the door behind him (she locked the door again at this point, and the light came back on...for as much good as it would evidently do). Upon returning to her seat, she told me what happened. I stood up to question the steward on the matter. As our seats were very close to the first class area, I approached the divider between coach and first class. I made eye contact with the steward in question. I pointed at him, and said, loud enough to be heard, &#147You-- did you walk in on my girlfriend while she was in the bathroom?&#148 A stewardess rapidly approached me, coming from the first class cabin, between me and the creepy steward. The stewardess said, &#147That never happened.&#148 Stunned, I looked at her and asked, &#147Are you calling my girlfriend a liar?&#148 Again, the stewardess denied the incident took place. &#147It never happened. No one walked in on you in the bathroom.&#148 Both of us were now flabbergasted. This woman was calling the redhead a liar to her face. Needless to say, we&#146re really not used to being treated like that. I sat back down, and waited for the creepy steward to move back down the aisle past me. I asked the steward for his last name. He refused. I then asked for his FAA number. He replied with the number: 77952. His nametag read &#147John.&#148 He had white skin, a roundish noggin, brown hair, wore glasses, and stood about 5&#1466;&#146 6&#148, and appeared to be in his mid-20s. He looked every bit the skanky pervert. A few minutes later, a third flight crew member, another steward, came to our seats, and explained that the stewardess had notified the pilot of the discussion, and that the pilot had notified ground security forces, and that we would have to wait on the plane for everyone else to disembark, and be ready to meet security personnel at the terminal. We were shocked. Okay, so, literally-- they made a federal case out of it. I asked the steward if it was possible for the flight crew to open the door to the lavatories in case of an emergency. The steward denied they had such a capability. Upon landing, we were met at the door of the aircraft by a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Officer, and AmericaWest Manager Dusela Stakelja. I recounted the events to both men. Both the cop and Stakelja seemed satisfied that we weren&#146t skyjacking terrorists. Stakelja explained, twice, that there was no way the door to the lavatory could have been opened if it were locked. I made sure to ask that particular question. We asked if AmericaWest was going to check the aircraft, and the door in question, to see if it were possibly defective. Stakelja replied in the negative. We asked the cop if he would interview the flight crew; Stakelja interrupted and stated that he had interviewed the flight crew. The cop asked Stakelja if he (Stakelja) wanted anything more concerning the situation; Stakelja again replied in the negative. The cop then said we were free to go. Let&#146s make something perfectly clear: we are not in the habit of causing security incidents. In fact, I served as an officer in the Air Force, and both of us have worked as security consultants, for clients that have included the federal government. To make the point plain, we have both worked on security programs for the Transportation Security Administration, and have held government security clearances. What, in fact, seems to have occurred is much worse than an AmericaWest employee overreacting to an upset passenger: indeed, it seems far more likely that the stewardess in question elevated the nature of the encounter so as to obviate her coworker&#146s intrusion on my girlfriend. We have no way of knowing whether the steward was making a simple mistake when he barged in on the redhead, or whether the circumstances were more sinister...but we do know that the situation could have remedied, to our satisfaction at the time, if the creepy steward had simply apologized to her. We also could have probably been mollified if the stewardess had later explained to me that she had to protect the first class cabin, and that I would have to sit down and wait until she was available to discuss the situation with him. An apology at that point might have sufficed. Instead, we were treated like miscreants and criminals, for a mistake the aircrew made. Moreover, we were called liars. Which really exacerbated the situation. Especially since we were lied to by AmericaWest employees, more than once: the flight crew can, indeed, open the bathroom doors on passenger aircraft: by lifting the &#147Occupied&#148 label on the outside of the door, and sliding the auxiliary lock. Several friends of ours, airline pilots, explained this to us. As they did not mention that functionality is classified, we feel no need to protect that information-- and, in fact, think all passengers should know that the flight crew has that capability. Go ahead-- try it on the next commercial flight you&#146re on. Moreover, we think that all travelers should know exactly what happened that day, which is why I&#146m publishing this letter. We want people to know how we were treated. We want more, as well: we asked the airline to give us copies of any customer complaints regarding that flight crew for the past 18 months, particularly anything that might concern harassment and activity of a sexual nature, especially involving &#147John 7952.&#148 If AmericaWest has a pervert in their employ, their customers need to know-- if AmericaWest has people who make mistakes and don&#146t apologize, customers need to know that, too. US Airways, the owner of America West, refused to gives us any information, or even to apologize, either for the incident, or for lying to us repeatedly. This entire incident was egregiously troubling. We have thought for a good while about how to approach our response. This is what we came up with: exposing the problem. From now on, when we fly, we will pay extra to take any airline that isn&#146t America West or US Airways. We&#146re afraid of creepy perverts who are protected by overzealous crew members and backed by corporate liars.

317521;"i flew America West (flight 777) from philadelphia to las vegas, and return, las vegas to phoenix to philadelphia in march 2001. i was very anxious of flying america west for my first time after reading mostly negative reviews, but my experience was not so bad. philly to las vegas, flight 777, was aboard seemingly a brand new plane. the flight was in the air within half an hour or so of scheduled departure, which i think is normal, and arrived on schedule in las vegas. overall, the flight was slightly better than average i thought, since it was aboard such a clean, big, new plane. my only complaint, and its somewhat significant, was that there was no snack on this five hour journey, aside from that tiny snack pack they give you with drinks. however, the flight departed at 9-10pm from philly, so maybe that's normal. but whatever the case, i would have liked a snack. las vegas to phoenix to philly was just about as good a flight as i could expect. both flights were in the air within ten minutes of scheduled departure. both flights were relatively comfortable, lunch on one of the flights was average, not too bad. overall, i thought the flights were about as good as i could expect without being amazing or outstanding. the steward was even funny, he quipped ""welcome to flight 251, phoenix to philadelphia, today we'll be making our first on-time departure in nearly three weeks."" most of the passengers burst out laughing, so did i."
330345;"Imagine going on a business trip... and the wait to get home to your wife and children... Imagine arriving at the airport, with the return portion of your roundtrip ticket in your hand... And imagine being turned away at the gate FORTY FIVE minutes before your flight is to leave, without any sort of accommodation or consolation, because the airline overbooked the flight that YOU already had a paid seat on! That's what happened on my husband's last flight via America West. He was turned away at the gate, and they told him &quot;Go **** yourself&quot;. They didn't offer him a refund, didn't find him a seat on another flight or anything. He was stuck at the airport at 11pm at night desperately trying to find a way home to his family. Of course, they don't treat all of their customers this way - No, they found a way to accommodate two passengers who approached the gate after my husband left. Eventually my husband was able to find a first class flight home via Northwest, but no thanks to America West for sure! For corporate use, or as a family, we will not be using America West again. Their customer service is absolutely abominable. After calling up America West the next day, my husband was able to get half of his round-trip fare refunded, but that was it. No apologies or consolations for the inconvenience or bad attitudes!!"
335033;The purpose of the trip was to attend a family reunion and then a much needed vacation. Our trip was easy to book, I booked for myself, fiance and my brother on the same flight going but different returning. There were NO non stop trips from New York to San Diego so we had a stop over in Vegas which was our destination for the second leg of the trip. The flight was ok but when we got to the gate, since it was an early flight, my brother asked the attendant if breakfast would be served-her response was a flat no. Thankfully I have watched too many movies in which the plane get lost in some obscure place and had packed some snacks and drinks to tide us over. Before the plane took off we had enough time to grab a quick breakfast. The seats were ample even for someone a little overweight like myself, the ride was comfortable. We were able to sit together and the flight took off without any delays. The stop over in vegas was short we were let out of the plane...maybe fifteen minutes to a half hour. Again we took off without a hitch. Our trips back, my brother did not go to Las Vegas and says his trip was great but once again no meal but since he had remembered he ate a meal and took a snack. We went to Las Vegas, the plane left one time. Our final flight home also left on time. This flight was the scariest, We were settled in our seats, just gotten the permission to remove our seatbelts and then the plane took a dive and the turbulence made for bumpy moments before the pilot regained control. For whatever reason my fiance and I remained calm, but people around us were screaming. The weird thing was the pilot never said what happened or came over the intercom to reassure us that all was ok. When everything was calm again we asked the flight attendant what happened and all she said was there was turbulence and the pilot had it under control now. Throughout all the flights, while the staff was not rude they were not friendly.
340569;My second flight in all my life was on America West. I had previously flown on the now defunct Kiwi Airlines and I figured anything had to be better than that. Altogether it was. Every one of the employees of America West that I came into contact with was very pleasant and eager to answer any questions my little mind could think up. They arrived promptly and departed as scheduled. The seats on the airplane were extremely uncomfortable. My back was aching so bad I could barely stand up by the end of the flight. The seats were very cramped with about 3 inches from the seat in front of me. That way not sound like a problem, but I'm much smaller than the average person so these seating arrangements are bound to aggravate most people. The meals that were served were hardly enough. Lunch consisted of the choice of chicken salad or corned beef. I chose the chicken salad, which wasn't bad if you ignored the four miniature pieces of chicken and disgusting dressing. Dinner was teriyaki chicken salad (they seem to really like chicken salads) and chicken enchiladas. Me not being on for enchiladas I chose the salad again. The chicken wasn't bad, but there still wasn't enough of it. I'd recommend trying to fly another airline, but if you get stuck with America West it's not that terrible. Just remember to eat before a long flight. You'll be happy you did.
345534;We flew from Orlando to Phoenix about three years ago just before Christmas. The worst part of our experience was trying to find a place to park our car in Orlando! We won't fly out of Orlando at Christmas time again. Perhaps we don't expect much by way of food, because that's never an issue with us since our flights are seldom more than two or three hours. The flight was uneventful and the attendants courteous and helpful for the few things we needed. It may help that our son works for British Airways as a regional manager and it was he that arranged this particular flight. Our experience was positive, but we had no stop overs either way since that is a direct flight for America West. We have experienced some tense moments in travelling from Orlando to the Pacific Northwest (Seattle) with flight delays that caused missed connecting flights. (Different Airline). The bottom line is that I think stiff competition and the increase in air travel by the general public has depersonalized service considerably over the years. Rarely have I seen people in the airline industry who were genuinely enthusiastic about what they do for a living. It's a hectic business, airline employees and those that have missed connections are vying for unfilled seats on overbooked flights, and I don't believe any airline is really worse or better than another these days. It's a situation ripe for flaring tempers.
353838;"It would soon be the Fourth of July weekend of 2000. I was very excited to see my girlfriend, and spend time in New York during this holiday. After having moved to L.A. last year, I am always excited to return to New York. New York has real pizza, White Castle hamburgers, Yankee Stadium, my sweet girlfriend, and real pizza. Don?t you worry about my priorities. Since I am a dumbass, I was late in booking my flight. Thirteen days ahead (just one day shy of the much safer 14-day prior booking mark), I didn?t have much of a choice. Being a very busy holiday weekend, availability was very slim, and America West?s fares were hundreds of dollars more affordable. You know how wacky fares can be; the fare for one flight can be $550 while the fare for another similar one can equal a second mortgage. My girlfriend, who ran into serious problems with American Airlines, concurred that America West might be a good choice. And who could blame her? She went through all sorts of hell with American, and America West gave her no problems and a smooth flight experience. Lucky her. Here was my flight plan: Friday 6/30/00, American West Flight 2247 from LAX at 9:45pm to Las Vegas at 10:46pm. From there, there was another flight from Vegas to JFK in NY. I can?t recall those exact flight numbers and times, but it doesn?t matter, because my initial Vegas flight was canceled! Canceled flights are fun! This became one of those times when people come together to stand strong and face adversity with the knowledge that we are not alone in our fight. So, we waited in line. And we waited for a long time. Initially, when I saw the massive length of the America West check-in line, I knew something was wrong. I could have sworn I heard someone utter that very ugly word, ?canceled.? So, after asking the person in front of me to briefly watch my bag, I walked over to the monitors. Sure enough, Flight 2247 was canceled. How did I find out? Word of mouth and my own initiative. Was it via a PA announcement? Nope. Sure, they started with the PA a little while later, but not soon enough. Only at one point did an America West representative walk along the line confirming the cancellation. He did not have the time nor the inclination to offer much more information. There were two lines, and the huge one, apparently, was only for victims of 2247 who wanted to rebook. This man managed to tell me that there were no more available flights that evening, nor did any other airlines have room for us; this huge line is for people wanting to rebook for an earlier flight the next day. His vague answer to the ?Why was the flight canceled?? question was, ?mechanical issues.? But I still had many questions: ?In case you didn?t know, my ultimate destination is New York, not Las Vegas. Did you check on direct flights to New York, or check out connections via cities other than Las Vegas? Did you really check other airlines? Is there a chance that some available way to get to New York is just slipping away because I?m on a line that isn?t moving?? Truly, this line moved 15 feet over the first 2-hour period. Why so slow? In my short experience with America West, I had found them to be grossly understaffed at check-in terminals. There were 3 people dealing with a full plane?s worth of unhappy people. It literally took between 20 minutes to half and hour to deal with each person?s rebooking needs. This was mostly due to the understaffing, but also because of their disorganization. The reps were running around like chickens without heads. I was p i s s e d about my situation, but I also felt sorry for them. Among the rumors and the mumblings through the PA, I found out that most people were getting rebooked for a flight on United the following day. And it wasn?t for an early flight, either. Throughout all of this, as mentioned above, people near each other became temporary friends, crutches and luggage watchers. I found an ally in a woman who?s intended destination was my own: New York. She was a real go-getter, and she repeatedly tried to get answers when we were in the dark. Every time, though, she walked back without news. She watched my bag for me when I smoked 3 cigarettes at once, when I peed, and when I went to the pay phone. If you want something done right... I called American Airlines. Funny, but I almost had a heart attack when it took 6 full minutes for 800 Directory Assistance to get me the number. Ever heard of that? Anyway, I got American on the phone and told them my sad story. They were happy to inform me that they have flights direct from LAX to JFK on the hour, the next one being the following morning at 7am. Contrary to America West?s blanket statement of zero availability of flights on other airlines, a seat was available on the 7am flight. ?I?ll take it!!!? I vowed to make damned sure that America West would fully transfer my fare to American Airlines. So, the long and short of it was that, by my own hand, I was able to get a flight that would arrive in NY only eight hours later than I had originally planned. If I had left it up to the flawed and unorganized methods of America West, I would have landed in NY that Saturday night at around 10pm, instead of my actual 3:25pm arrival. Armed with my American Airlines flight reservation, I stepped up to what had become a free-for-all with the huge line and several shorter lines. From the shorter line, which was really just some makeshift way of cutting the big line since it had no real other purpose, I had the transfer completed. Before getting on a real flight (where the plane actually takes you from one city to another)... America West was quite happy to give us free hotel and meal vouchers in order to compensate for our inconveniences. They were sacrificing themselves to appease the angry Customer Gods. They put me up and the Embassy Suites (nice) near LAX. When I asked the very courteous AmWest guy about the possibility of a warm meal, he handed me these meal vouchers saying that Embassy Suites had an all-night restaurant, and that they?d take care of me. Liar!! The Suites were very nice, but their restaurant closed at midnight, along with room service. What? Anyway, my dinner at 2am was Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies and shrimp-flavored Ramen Noodles (wow, a vending machine that dispenses Ramen!). But I was quite angry that the misinformation continued. If the Embassy Suites doesn?t have a 24-hour restaurant, America West shouldn?t tell us otherwise. They should be better informed so as not to lie to us. I felt betrayed. The Embassy Suites were nice, but I was only there from 2:30am to 5:30am. Luckily, at 6am, I was able to use one of my meal vouchers to get two sausage-egg-and-cheese Crossanwiches at the Burger King, back at LAX. A breath of fresh air In the 6am hour, immediately upon entering the check-in line at American Airlines, I was approached by an American employee who told me that I didn?t even have to wait to check in there. Because I only had carry-on luggage, I could check in quicker at the gate. She looked at my transfer doo-hickey and reaffirmed that it could be done. God bless that woman. And so, I had a wonderful 5 days with my sweetie. We did lots of fun stuff, some of which are illegal in eleven states. In fact, we had some much fun that we were late in getting back to JFK to catch my return flight--again, America West. This time, of course, the flight left on time. Here we go again? Initially understaffed again at the JFK terminal, I waited on line a while before reaching the check-in counter. There, I was told that I could get on standby for the next flight to Las Vegas. At least, I think that?s what the rep said. I was a little hard to tell considering her impenetrable Croatian accent. Anyway, details spared, it felt like I was doing her job for her. Providing that I could get on this next standby flight, I might be able to get an earlier flight for the second leg from Vegas to L.A. (my initial booking would have had me waiting for 4 hours between flights in Vegas). I had to pull teeth to get a boarding pass for that flight, not because of availability problems, but because of communication problems between myself and the heavily-accented, less-than-extremely-knowledgeable rep. So, I went to the gate check-in and requested a standby seat. The guy with the blond highlights took my information and assured me that he?d call my name. Between tearful kisses between me and my sweetie, I monitored the situation. People were boarding and my name had not been called. Almost all people boarded, and my name had not been called. Finally, there were the last two people boarding, and no one was left at the gate. My name had not been called. I approached the guy with the blond highlights and he looked at me as if this was our first meeting. Didn?t he remember? I had to spell it out: ?I?m waiting for standby.? ?Oh, you?re on standby?? He quickly printed a boarding pass, tore off the stub and handed it to me. ?Here you are.? Sure, I was relieved, but I?m sure that if I didn?t approach him, he would?ve forgotten me. Again, I was having communication problems with America West. Well, I got on the plane and was headed to Las Vegas. It would be a five-hour flight. T+15 min.: I watched the preview for Mission to Mars. T+25 min.: I got my Bloody Marys. T+40 min.: The movie started. What? Don?t they usually serve food before the movie? T+60 min.: I asked a flight attendant if there was meal service. I?ve never had to ask this question before. I?ve either been on 1-hour flights where I knew there?d only be a drink and a snack, or 5- to 8-hour flights, where asking that question never entered my mind. But here, I had to ask it, ?cause I was getting hungry. ?No.? ?What? Are you fucking kidding me? No meal service on a 5-hour flight? What the fuck is wrong with your airline?? These were thoughts, not uttered out loud for the nice flight attendant to ponder. I had given up trying to communicate with them. It would be just me and my thoughts now. They no longer deserved my questions, my interest, my time, or my business. I thought, ?Fuck America West!? Knowing not to trust the gate information on the boarding pass for my next flight, as soon as I landed in Vegas, I checked with AmWest information. They confirmed that even though it clearly says ?Gate 24?, it?s really Gate D-4. But, I guess I should have known that 24 and D-4 were the same, right? Glad I checked. I had just enough time to pee, have half of a cigarette (God bless LAS?s smoking lounge; all airports should have them), get two Whopper Jr.?s (no tomato, no pickle), a muffin and a Dr. Pepper from Burger King, and get my ass on the last damned America West flight I would ever take in my life. The flight attendant offered me a drink on the short LAS to LAX flight. ?No thanks, I?m covered.? The bottom line America West is understaffed at airport terminals. America West has horrible communication practices when dealing with both adverse situations and normal booking procedures. America West did not have meal service on my 5-hour flight. I will not fly America West again. Afterthought--not a retraction: I bet that anyone can have a bad experience with any airline. America West didn?t do well for me, but it may do fine for others who might not run into the same problems. In this story, American Airlines and Burger King were my saviors. In other stories, they could be the enemy.

354157;"First of all, happy new year! After searching, I have finally found the correct listing for America West the airlines in Hotels and Travel. I found if I type in ""America West"" in the Epinions searchbox and search under all categories, it only comes up on page four. Searching for ""America West airlines"" brings it up to the first page, second listing. Sorry for originally posting my review in the online stores & services listing. I will never fly with this airline again. I'll start with the negatives, since they will make up the majority of this review. Today, on our way back from Phoenix to Vancouver(direct), our flight took off from the runway one hour late. Now, with all the extra security precautions and due diligence that goes along with that, you might not think that one hour is that bad. However, not fifteen minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave, the information on the board at our gate said that the flight would be on time. My father and I arrived at the boarding gate about an hour before the flight was scheduled to leave. The gate was already crowded. They had a message up saying that the flight was overbooked, and that they were looking for volunteers. Uh oh was the first thing that came to mind. The America West staff made several announcements to let everyone know that they needed volunteers, and that they were offering US$300 in travel credit to be used on their airline. We might have thought about volunteering were it not New Year's Eve and we needed to get back for other reasons too. Anyways, we both went to get some breakfast and came back about fifteen minutes later, only to see the airline now offering US$400 in credit for volunteers. Since we booked e-tickets for the flight, we did not yet have seats assigned at that point. I went to the gate and asked about getting seats, and was told that they just needed four more volunteers, and they would help us out shortly. Anyhow, to make a long story short, we boarded a little bit late, and after sitting in the plane for 30-45 minutes, we finally took off at about 12:05, an hour late. That was quite bad. It's even worse if you consider that our America West flight from Vancouver to Phoenix was also delayed for the same reason - that the airline had overbooked seats. Although on that leg of our journey, everyone was actually on the airplane before they realized their mistake. Somehow or other they corrected it in about half the time it took for the above situation. On the return leg, when we eventually did get up in the air I had more problems. Being in Arizona for about a week, I found myself consuming a lot of water. So naturally I brought a bottle on the plane with me. It didn't take long for the container to run dry, and so about half an hour into the flight I was in need of more H20. I pushed the attendant button. There had been some turbulence shortly after we reached cruising altitude. Still, the turbulence only lasted about fifteen or twenty minutes, and I had requested assistance about 3/4 of the way through the turbulent spell. The light above me indicating that I wanted some attention from a staff member stayed illuminated for half an hour before I got service. None of the crew walked up or down the aisle for at least twenty-five minutes during that period. When I did finally get service, it wasn't because the light was on - they didn't even notice it. One of the crew was slowly handing out drinks one aisle at a time, and I did finally get some water at that point. About an hour after I pressed the call button, I switched it off, noting that they had paid me no attention as a result of it. I find this situation very serious. What would have happened if I had been having trouble breathing? Or, g-d forbid if the passenger next to me had a heart attack? Would they have told me that there had been turbulence, and as a result for their safety and ours they could not help anyone? I'm sorry, but that is just not good enough. These are our first experiences with America West. Both direct flights took about three hours. I found there was very little legroom to speak of - we were in coach on a Boeing 737. Once I'd put my magazine and water bottle in the pouch in front of me, my legroom was even further restricted. I also noticed that, on both occasions before takeoff, there was no baggage/seat check to make sure that all baggage was properly stowed, and that all seats were in the full upright position. On the flight to Phoenix, I had my seat all the way back, as I noticed a few other passengers had theirs. I even saw one lady lying over her partner's lap during takeoff! I cannot review their food because all we got was a bag of pretzels each way. Soft drinks, juice and water is complimentary - if they choose to serve you. Customers can also purchase alcoholic beverages for an extra cost. It wasn't all bad. I suppose I should also cut the airline and their staff some slack because it is the holiday season, and I know this is a very busy time of year for them. That's probably a good reason for their overbooking the flights. Both times we checked in - in Vancouver and in Phoenix - I found their check-in areas to be clean and well-staffed. Although there were lineups both times, there wasn't much of a wait. To my recollection AW employees who were serving customers occupied all of the available desks. I didn't have a problem with the seats on the 737s. I usually have some difficulty getting to sleep while in the air, but I had no problems this time around. Leather seating would have been more comfortable. On the way to Phoenix, I found that there was no air-conditioning or fan above my head. Usually you'll find the fan next to the light, and you can turn the fan on or off. Not so on that flight, which made the aircraft quite stuffy and hot. I should also mention that I found some garbage in the seatback pocket and in the small ashtray-size compartment between our seats. The plane had been cleaned, but it must have been done quickly or not thoroughly enough. The supplied magazines were well worn, with bent covers and more. I cannot really comment on the on-board entertainment because there wasn't any to speak of. Only the AW magazine and their catalog of merchandise is supplied in the seatback pocket. Of course you'll also find an air-sickness bag and instructions on how to exit the aircraft in an emergency. There was no radio/music service onboard and no TV shows or movies shown on either of our flights. The AW employees that explained how to buckle one's seatbelt were not that entertaining either. We did a lot of research online before booking our flight and hotel. Eventually we booked through flight centre. Comparing apples to apples on the individual websites of airlines and on expedia.ca and travelocity.ca , I believe we paid about $200-$300 more than the lowest rate quoted. However, we paid more for the privilege of flying direct both ways. Otherwise we would have faced taking two or more planes each way - routing via Las Vegas and Los Angeles,etc. I am giving America West 2 stars out of 5. Takeoff on the way there was 30 minutes late, and on the way back was 60 minutes late. I would certainly not recommend them after my experience. They have a lot to learn when it comes to customer service. Their attitude seems to be that customers will fly with them no matter what because they are a low-cost airline. The only other American airline that I have flown with in recent memory is United, and I can tell you that United was much better. Westjet, the Canadian airline which I wrote a recent Epinion on, is simply the best airline I've ever flown with. The way they treat people, and the way they approach flying is refreshing. America West could really learn a lesson from any of these airlines. If you've seen Airline on A&E, and you think Southwest is bad, you ain't seen nothin' yet."
357689;"I rarely review products that have been reviewed a lot already, and I certainly have never reviewed a product that has 217 reviews to its credit. However, I will review America West for no other reason than that I feel like unloading what was possibly the worst experience on an airline that I have ever had. Let me start by saying, before buying a ticket on America West, I checked Epinions. I saw that it had an overall rating of 2 stars, based on over 200 reviews. I read several horror stories. Alarm bells were ringing. But, after closing out the Epinions window, I went back to buy my ticket. The America West ticket, from Tucson to Hartford (connecting in Phoenix) cost approximately $180, compared to $300-$400 from other airlines. Also, I was trying to fit a flight into a day with a very tight schedule, and the America West flight was the only one that really fit my schedule well. And anyway, there were a few people who had good experiences. In the end, I ignored my instinct and decided to save 120 bucks. When I arrived at Tucson International, they told me my flight was delayed one hour, and would leave at approximately 3:10. As I soon found out, however, it is safe to tack on 20-30 minutes to any America West flight, even in perfect weather. In this case, the weather was poor, so I can&#146t hold the initial delay against them. However, I was scheduled to catch a connecting flight in Phoenix departing at 4:10. I asked the customer service rep if I would have enough time to catch the connecting flight. He assured me I would. So, 3:10 rolls around and, surprise surprise, we haven&#146t even boarded yet. I went to the counter again and asked about the connecting flight, and whether I should try to get on another flight. He assured me I would still have enough time and that they would hold the flight for me if I arrived close to the departure time. We finally boarded at about 3:15 and took off at about 3:30. We arrived in Phoenix at 4:15. I quickly checked the departure board. Not surprisingly, my plane had departed without me. I quickly went to the Customer Service Desk and waited for about 45 minutes behind a long line of people in a similar predicament. After about an hour, another America West representative told us we could go to another customer service desk where there would be less of a wait. I hurried across the airport to the other desk, where there was no line (which they could have let us know, say, 45 minutes earlier). The customer service rep nicely informed me that there was not another flight to Hartford until the next day &#150 at 4:10 pm. She said I could spend the night in Phoenix. However, the airline could not pay for my hotel. I asked them if they could check with another airline. Nope, sorry &#150 can&#146t do that either. I asked them about a flight to Boston; sorry, that flight just left. This was a nice kick in the cajones, since I had asked the customer service rep in Tucson about getting on another flight, and specifically mentioned Boston. Basically, the sole job of the customer service representative in Phoenix was to inform me of all the things that the airline could not do to help me. And believe me, as much as I wanted to blow up at the customer service rep, I stayed calm, realizing that it wasn&#146t her personal fault that the company was so lousy. I finally got booked on a red-eye to Boston. Adding to the list of things America West couldn&#146t do for me, they politely told me that if I took the flight to Boston, I would be on my own to get to Hartford. Luckily for me, I live in neither city &#150 Boston was just a slightly longer drive to my home, and more of a pain in the butt to drive out of. However, this was yet another &#147screw you&#148 from the company. The red-eye was due to board at 8:15 (so I had to wait 3 hours in the airport) and connect in Las Vegas. I was supposed to depart from gate A-6. About 20 minutes before boarding, they suddenly decided to change gates. The Las Vegas flight boarded on time, but still departed 10-15 minutes later than the posted time. Upon arriving in Vegas, I went to the gate printed on my ticket: B-22. They had two flights listed on that gate, one leaving at 11:35 and one leaving at 12:25. So, when they began boarding for the 11:35, they had to specifically instruct people on the Boston flight not to board, lest they end up in Tampa. Brilliant. The first flight, of course, didn&#146t begin boarding until approximately 11:15, and didn&#146t take off until about 12. Now, we were supposed to start boarding our flight at 11:50. Yet, there was another plane sitting at our gate. And they didn&#146t bother to change the time posted for our flight. At 12, they announced that our gate had changed. So, 150 people got up and moved to the new gate. 10 minutes later, they made another announcement: the gate had changed, again. And again, 150 people got up and moved to the new gate. We finally boarded and took off about 20 minutes late, which, given everything, was better than I hoped for. The end result of my $120 savings? I was supposed to arrive in Hartford at 10:45 pm. I ended up arriving in Boston at 8:40 am on the following day, with a bag full of headaches and hassles to boot. I do have to say, in fairness to America West, there are a couple of positives to speak of. Obviously, the first is the price. Also, the planes were very clean and looked almost brand new &#150 much better condition than most planes from major airlines. It is a no-frills airline, but it is still fairly comfortable. The flight attendants were generally helpful and polite. Beyond these few positives, however, I have very little good to say about America West. I might add, I fly frequently, and I&#146ve been on just about every major airline, including a few foreign ones. I&#146ve had my share of delays and cancellations. Yet, in nearly every instance, the airlines I flew on were generally helpful and accommodating; without exception, they all did what it took to get me to the right city in a reasonable amount of time. I can forgive delays due to weather &#150 hey, it happens. However, America West is distinct in my mind for doing absolutely nothing to compensate or accommodate its passengers. The frequent gate changes, constant delays, and the incompetent/unhelpful customer service, are all signs of a horribly disorganized, uncaring, and amateurish airline. I understand it is &#147no-frills.&#148 I would have been happy flying in a cramped seat on a C-130, as long as I arrived at my destination in a reasonable time. But having to arrive in a different city, 10 hours later than I was supposed to, is not no-frills. It is no service, and no sense. And both describe America West more aptly than no-frills can. I know, fellow travelers, you too will be tempted by the low price. But trust me, you are playing with fire. In the end, it is not worth the hassle."
357702;but what airline is? I've been flying America West for several years now, 2-3 times a year, cross country, and I've watched it deteriorate right before my eyes. But to be fair, other domestic airlines that I've flown, with the exception of United, also didn't fail to disappoint. When AW first started out, they had clean planes, pillows and blankets all around, actual meals on flights, and fewer delays. Now, the planes are dirty on a good day and downright filthy on a bad day, they serve horribly nasty little snack bags on all flights under 5 hours, and a delay is routine but is still something you can't avoid by arriving later because they will give your seat to someone else if you don't show up on time to check in. A note about the snack bags: you get a small, very cold sandwich with exactly one slice of cold cuts and one slice of cheese. There is also a miniature apple usually and some sort of chips. On two occasions, the tortilla chips we had were clearly spoiled, and no, there were no replacements. In addition, the crew waits a good 30-40 minutes after distributing the snack bags to give out the drinks.....thanks, that's OK, I don't need to drink with my meal, or even right after....take your time. A note on plane cleanliness: Dirty seats, used pillows and blankets (that is, if you can get your hands on any), bathrooms worse than outhouses (can you hold it in for another few hours, hmmm?), and tray tables that look as if they haven't been cleaned for a year. Two good things about AW though: their frequent flyer program is one of the few that still offers a domestic free ticket for 20,000 miles. I've flown free several times with them and as long as you book in advance, it's great. The second good thing is their employees, at least the customer service and reservations people. I've never had a problem with them and they were always courteous and helpful. I like my low-priced tickets as much as the next person, but I'd pay a little more for a cleaner plane, real food, and bathrooms that are ones you can actually use without needing to get shots first. There is definitely room for improvement here.
362343;I chose to fly America West on a recent trip to L.A. from New York (JFK) airport. I chose them because they had the best rates at the time, about $330 per person, round trip plus taxes. I ordered the tickets over the phone and got them promptly two days later. On the day of the flight, check in was relatively fast and I got the Isle seat that I requested. There was a two hour delay to board the plane because they were running behind on flights, some passengers told me that they experienced delayed flights before with America West. We finally boarded and were on our way, the take off was smooth and the plane was relatively clean with comfortable seats, though we were not flying during a meal time for a 4+ hour flight they did not give you anything to eat outside of peanuts and drinks, the pilot made up for the time we were delayed in New York though, we arrived in L.A. almost at the time originally anticipated, the landing was also smooth and comfortable, and they let us out of the plane promptly with no delays, there were also no problems or delays with the luggage. On the return trip home there were no delays or problems, however we did have a 1 1/2 hour stop over in Las Vegas before returning to New York. Overall my experience with America West was a pleasant one, and they exceeded my expectations.
367076;"BOARDING Cattle call would be a better word. America West does the most disorganized boardings I have ever experienced. The gate agents mumble into the microphone. Since no one can be sure of what they are saying, the passengers have to guess which rows are being called. If anyone shows up before their turn, the agents develop a nasty attitude. PUNCTUALITY One flight arrived twenty minutes early. A good thing, right? Nope. They couldn't find a gate. We waited almost 30 minutes on the tarmac, the blistering Phoenix sun beating down. There is nothing more frusturating than sitting cooped up in a hot plane, with the terminal in sight yet out of reach. What annoyed me the most was that the flight crew did not update us on what was happening. THE FLIGHT CREW Where DO they find these people? On my first flight, the attendant neglected to offer me the peanuts which came with the drink service. When I asked for some, she looked at me like I was Porky Pig. Then, she spilled a cup of ice all over me. &quot;Darn,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;I thought that might happen.&quot; By far, she was the most heinous flight attendant I have ever seen. In fact, she was a scowling old hag. In my book, flight crews do NOT have to be thin, young and beautiful. They should at least have a pleasant smile, though. She also could barely speak English. Her language skills were poor enough that she could not understand the questions which passengers were asking.What if there had been an emergency? On all of the flights, the flight crew seemed highly challenged by the microphone. They would start the usual announcements, then their voices would trail off in a spattering of &quot;uhs&quot; and &quot;ums.&quot; I had never seen anything like it before. It was almost like they forgot what they were going to say. THE FOOD Tiny portions of stale food. Enough said. LUGGAGE They did not lose my bags. Good job America West! They did, however, bungle the stroller I checked at the gate. Unlike a competitor airline, they took forever to bring it to me while I languished inside the sky ramp. By the time the stroller arrived, I had a fussy baby squirming in my arms and a panicked husband wondering why we hadn't come through the gate yet. TRAVELLING WITH AN INFANT Besides the problem I mentioned above, there was also a mix up with the seating assignments. America West KNEW I was travelling with a baby, because I purchased a seat for him at the infant rate. There is a federal regulation that infants must sit in the window seat, so that in case of an emergency, they don't block the way.I was not aware of the rule until I sat down in the plane. They assigned us the center and aisle seats instead. When the stewardess came and told the lady in the window seat that she would have to switch, the woman was outraged and gave me nasty looks for the rest of the flight."
367402;"I flew America West twice. After the terrible experience the first time, you would have thought I'd learned my lesson! I booked NON stop flights each way, purchased 6 tickets, including one for my infant daughter. When booking the flights, the reservationist repeatedly reminded me that children under the age of 2 didn't require a ticket to fly. Flying from LA to Baltimore, I decided that buying the extra ticket was a good idea. So, I purchased it anyway. The reservationist also told me that the use of car seats on the flights may make the flight more uncomfortable due to &quot;crowding&quot;. Hhhmmmmm Ok, without a notion of the nightmare to come, my fellow traveller's and myself proceeded to LAX to depart. The flight was delayed by over an hour! It was also overbooked by at least a dozen people. I was called up to the desk at the gate THREE times to see if I was willing to accept a travel voucher in exchange for my daughter's seat. I repeatedly answered &quot;no&quot;. Ok, now it's time to board. They boarded by ROWS! Forget the folks waiting by the door in wheelchairs, forget the lady with the broken leg and using crutches, and forget the passengers holding wiggling babies. The inside of the plane was cramped, a 757 I believe. So, off we go to the back of the plane. Our 6 seats were booked together so we could stay together. Yes, the airline attendant attempted to coerce me into giving up my baby's seat by the window, even taunting me with the rule that babies under 2 years of age don't need a separate seat. I stood firm, my daughter slept in her carseat, and was asked by four different flight attendants if I had &quot;bought&quot; my daughter's seat. The &quot;nonstop&quot; flight had an &quot;unscheduled&quot; plane change in Las Vegas plus a 45 minute delay. They did offer to allow initial boarding to people who needed assistance, but the gate attendants allowed people travelling alone, without handicaps, to board as well. On the next flight, we had to make an &quot;unscheduled&quot; plane change in Phoenix, my son vomited and the flight attendants refused to assist in clean up, and I was again grilled about purchasing my daughter's seat. No, I wouldn't recommend this airline to a friend. I might recommend this airline to someone I wished the worst on though. When I called to complain about the horrific ordeal, I was rewarded by a customer service representative who feverishly defended America West to the hilt. Oh, did I mention that I was offered MORE America West travel vouchers for my troubles? No thanks!"
368047;"From my personal experience I have seen that the claim to be &quot;America West&quot; is clearly mistaken and should be called AMERICA'S WORST!!! I encountered a problem with this airline about 2 months ago, my family and I were heading to see relatives in Arizona, when an announcment came across, stating that our flight had been delayed only 15 minutes. I had wishful thinking and didn't think much of the 15 minute wait but 15 minutes ended up turning out to be 3 hours. Then on the way home from Arizona back to Florida, they started off with the same 15 minute delay, and the flight ended up being CANCELED! This isn't just a one time rare occurance. My brothers in both Arizona and in New York have also encountered problems with this airline. Why try to save that extra buck or two when it will end up costing you in the long run. My advice would be choose America Airlnes, Delta, or another airline which provides better service."
380219;"I just got back from a vacation in Las Vegas, it was my first time out there and it was a terrific trip all around, except for one thing, the flight on America West. I flew out of Newark on Monday morning. The moment my family walked into the terminal our troubles with AW began. The line for their ticket counter was absurdedly long. No big problem as we had made sure to arrive plenty early. The line did take about an hour to get through though, and the few staff they had to do crowd control were rude and did not seem to be well informed about their flights. Finally we arrived to a desk to find out that their computer system was down, thus holding up the line terribly. Fifteen minutes later we saw our baggage go down the conveyor belt with handwritten baggage tags on them. I wondered if we would see those bags in Vegas - luckily we did. Frustrated we walked to our gate only to sit there for 1 1/2 hours longer than scheduled for due to a 90 minute flight delay. Okay, flight delays are more common than on time flights in this industry, so I will not hold AW against for that. But I was upset because we (the passengers) were uninformed. It would have been helpful had they come over the loudspeaker and announced that yes, the flight was delayed, and possibly announce why and when they expected to get us in the air. That would have let go of the massive uncertainty. We got on the plane finally and sure enough the flight was overbooked. A steward made an announcement that this flight was to Las Vegas, not to Phoneix, and anyone booked on the Phoenix flight should get off ASAP. Now, why should someone with a different ticket have ever gotten on the plane at all? Aren't they supposed to check your boarding pass at the gate? They then still needed to have a few people give up their seats, something that could have been done much time before. So after another 30 minutes of them trying to find volunteers, we finally pushed back and were soon in the air. The flight itself was fine, no major turbelence, etc... But the stewards were rude and took their sweet time getting the drink service out. And then there was one time when a passenger behind me, upset over something, said &quot;You guys have no idea what you are doing&quot; to a steward. &quot;We don't argue that, we realize that&quot; was the response. Well, at least they can admit just how bad they are. Our flight back from Vegas was the red eye Friday night. The line at check in went quickly and the flight did depart on time, well close enough to schedule, only 15 minutes late or so. Most of the passengers were quick to go asleep once we were in the air. But the flight crew seemed to have no courtesy to us sleeping passengers as they felt the need to make three annoucements about the on flight movie (which I dont even think anyone watched) and then when they came around with the drink cart instead of talking softly, the talked very loudly. There was no need for me to hear &quot;Sir, would you like a drink&quot; for 20 minutes as they made their way down the cabin. Talking softly would have been nice. Overall, I was very disappointed with my first AW flight. I knew that they had poorly rated service, but choose to fly them because of a very attractive price. Next time that price will have to be incredibly cheap for me to fly America Worst again."
380276;"Usually when flying from/to atlanta, I tend to fly Delta Airlines but for my recent trip to attend Defcon in Las Vegas, my travel agent (soon to be ex-travel agent) steered me towards America West Airlines for$100 cheaper. Thinking to save my company the money, I agreed to book the cheaper flight. (Pity me oh ye gods) The flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas was uneventful. I had to wait a mere 2 hrs at the gate, and then another hour inside the plane before we took off. Naturally on this airline from hell, I couldn't have it as easy on the way back. My return flight (613) was slated to leave at 11:30pm (PDT) from Las Vegas direct to Atlanta. When I arrived with friends at the airport at 10pm (they were taking a Delta flight at 10:30) I saw that the America West flight was listed as being 'delayed' with an ETA of arrival - 1:45 AM. No worries..no panic. I called America West 800 number and after being put on hold and dropped TWICE, asked that they switch me to the Delta flight which was leaving in 20mins and which had 15 seats free. I was then told that my flight (which hadn't even landed) was under 'airport control'; any changes to my reservation had to be made at the Passenger Assistance Ticketing desk. Like a good suck..er consumer I walked my way across the airport to the Passenger Assistance area, where the line was approximately 75 people. Realizing it was hopeless to speak to anyone in time, I surrendered to the inevitability of waiting 3 hrs to get on my flight and made my way to the gate area. At the gate area, airport security had just arrived as well. Evidently one of the passengers (specifically an irate old lady) attempted to attack one of the gate agents (with a camera). With a certain foreboding I sat down on the wonderfully hard (builds character!) chairs and began waiting to the sounds of the slot machines. Slowly I watched the line of people waiting for their boarding passes grow ever longer (poor fools). Fast forward to 1:45am and there are now approximately 200 people in the gate area looking somewhat perky because passengers are now exiting from our gate. (Hey if people are leaving the plane we must be going on soon). In a weird replay of the prior two hrs however the EXITING passengers soon began to complain loudly when they were told they were in Las Vegas - evidently they had bought tickets for a direct flight to San Francisco. As much as I would like to detail the debacle of the San Francisco flight, I'd much rather focus on my own pitiful story. When my watch showed 2:00am the gate agent picked up her handset and announced that our flight had changed gates. The new gate (of course) was in another terminal. The bad news was we all had to walk to the other terminal , but the good news was I had an airplane (with wings and everything!). I arrived at the terminal and even SAW what was to be my plane, and so like a docile child settled down for boarding to be announced (after all they needed a few minutes to 'clean the aircraft'). 3:00am and I'm beginning to wonder if I'll ever see my home again. My eyes notice a single gate agent (hey where have all the other ones gone?) furtively pick up a handset and announces 'Ladies and Gentlemen flight 613 to Atlanta from Las Vegas has been cancelled, please go to Passenger Ticketing Assistance for Details'. The same gate agent then proceeded to do an admirable impression of Ben Johnson in the 100m dash as she dropped the handset and RAN from the gate area with befuddled sleepy passengers calling after her and asking each other what was going on. I not being one to complain walked my way over to the already familiar Passenger Ticketing Assistance area. Here there were passengers from THREE different flights all waiting to speak to someone who might tell them when they would be able to leave the Hell that had become Las Vegas Airport. Since I had arrived at the Ticketing Assistance area fairly quickly, there was only 70-80 people already lined up ahead of me. With two people manning the desk area I thanked my good fortune and settled down to wait. 4:45 am. I've moved up to a point in the line where I can see the light of the area where the desk of the agents might be. The light is suddenly obscured by an America West employee coming out and announcing that 'she is closing the Ticketing Assistance desk and going off shift, all passengers still needing assistance ( only a few hundred of us) should go back to Ticketing/Check-In at the front of the airport'. I'll give this lady credit, she did not deign to run away from the passengers, she simply ignored everyone and walked away. 5:40 am. After standing in line at the Ticketing/check-in counter I am FINALLY able to talk to someone. This lady informs me in a cheerful syrupy voice, that can only come from having a good nights sleep, that she can get me on an 11am flight to Orange County, CA! 'Wonderful' I say dryily, but I preferred to go home to Atlanta, as in Atlanta,GA. 'Not to worry' my fountain of cheer informs me because from Orange County I can take a flight after a 3hr layover direct to Atlanta! I asked her slowly what time I would be arriving in Atlanta and in the same voice she said 'oh 11:30pm'. ( yes a full 24hrs after my original scheduled departure). My agent of misery also told me that as compensation she would give me a 5minutes America West phone card, an 8 dollar meal voucher and a whopping $75 dollar off my 'next' America West round trip flight. All of this of course said with that same syrupy 'I slept on a real bed last night' voice. At this point dear reader I truly and sincerly wished this womans death. I also wished the bankruptcy and decimation of America West as a corporate entity, the biblical plagues against the FAA which allows this airline corporation to exist and an extra large pacifier for the 7mth old child attached to the mother in line behind me who had the sense to be screaming his head off. Instead of commiting homicide I said fine 'book it' and waited while my wonderfully efficient agent spent the next 20mins creating me a new boarding pass and ticket. 6:05 am. A supervisor walks in and speaks to an agent (a rather young man with his name 'Trainee' on his badge) standing next to mine in a rather loud grating voice 'We have to move all these people in line so we can proceed with the morning flight check-in'. The voices of the people behind me raised in a swell of protest. It sounded...hungry and rather primal, so much so that I swear I saw the supervisor take two steps back. The Trainee (a future candidate for the McArthur Genius Award) told the supervisor that if that was done there probably would be a riot. In any case I made my 11am flight (which took off at 11:40 natch) and from there took the atlanta flight which (of course was late) arrived at midnight Tuesday morning a full day after I had hoped to arrive in atlanta. What can I say? The only thing that could have been POSSIBLY worse in flying with America West would be if they had crashed...and even this would be a hairs breadth better, since a quick death is far preferable to a long agonizing torturous existence. Update: Recent ratings for customer service on all airlines have been released for 2001. Naturally America West came in dead last...http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010402/ts/airlines_service_dc_1.html"
381552;Was leaving BWI, heading for LasVegas for a family gathering and convention, flying America West Airlines. Checked in with no trouble. The lady at the counter was nice, talkative and informative answering all my questions. Tickets were all in order and luggage checked promptly. We left the airport on time. Had a lady pilot--believe it or not, she didn't even talk--especially to tell us about sights and cities below. The plane was clean, the attendants very helpful and courtious. Arrived non-stop on-time in LasVegas. Did notice we didn't have much leg room. The gentleman across the isle had no leg room, his knees were bumping into the seat ahead. We were flying in a 757. On the return trip, we left LasVegas on time..had a stop over in Phoenix after being told we had a direct flight. Even had to change planes. Had to walk with our carry-ons from one end of the Phoenix terminal to the other end. After all the walking in LasVegas, that's the last thing we wanted to do. At departure time, there was no plane, no explanation, noone to talk to about it even. Finally was told plane was delayed due to storms elsewhere. Two hours later, we departed. I was pleasantly surprised to see 6 flight attendants flying with us. We were also given free drinks as a reward for the long wait. The pilot kept telling us what sights and cities were below us at all times. Since I don't fly real often, I liked knowing where we were. Our snack left a lot to be desired--one nuked cheeseburger, a very small tossed salad with no choice of dressing and a .5oz bag of pretzels. That's not enough to hold you for 4 hours flying time. We were also served drinks twice during the flight. One could also ask for bottled water which is always good to keep with you. We arrived home, safe and sound, two hours late. All in all, it was a good experience with America West even with the 2 hour delay. I've flown before with them and was satisfied so will fly again with them. After all, I'm not perfect either.
385475;I recently flew this airline to albuquerque with a layover in Phoenix. The thing that drew me to the airline was the cheap price, which amazingly was cheaper than Southwest. The first thing I noticed when I boarded the flight was that the planes look somewhat shabby and beat up. The seats were old and there were these screens in front of each seat which seem to be television screens but they didn't show anything on them. The in flight magazines were torn up as well. That, though, was the worst part of the flight. The seats were pretty roomy, the service was fine and they were on time for all the flights except for one where there was about a 15 minute delay. The biggest pain was having to traverse from one concourse to another to change flights at Phoenix. It was a pretty good experience for a two hour flight, it got me where I wanted to go and on time so I can't really complain, but this was definitely not something to write home about.
392165;i have flown america west airlines 3 times in the past three years and each time i thaught it was just that one flight, but each time i came closer and closer to realizing that america west is really america worst. the in flight meal was always lame and the flight was always really late getting to my destination. the flight was usually supposed to be three hours, and usually turned into being four to five hours. i absolutely hate america west airlines. it may just be my luck though. if you want to try america west for your self go right on ahead. i dont recomend it though.
392498;Ever since the airline began having serious financial problems in the late eighties, they've gotten progressively worse. Why? As a columnist in the Phoenix area (the home of AWA), I can give you a little background on this situation. AWA employees took deep cuts in pay and benefits to help the airline return to profitability. The problem is that now AWA is very profitable - but they haven't given anything back yet. Flight crews are rude and discourteous because they're poorly compensated. The competent ones have left for other airlines, leaving only those who are clinging to their seniority with the company behind - and those folks seem more than happy to upset AWA passengers and hurt the company bottom line. Why hasn't AWA cleaned up their act? The big reason is that nobody has taken them to task on their shenanigans. The union gets no local support from the dominant local newspaper, because the board of the newspaper has a member who's also on the board at the airline. Very convenient. I refuse to fly AWA until they get new management and rectify the situation with their employees. Their service is abominable, and I'd sooner take a bus than board one of their planes.
397761;"I recently took a trip to Las Vegas using America West. It was not a good trip. I didn't have the problems many people have with flight delays, cancellations, etc. I just didn't have a very good trip. I took America West because it was part of a package deal; hotel and airfare were all together. I chose the America West package because it saved me money. Bad choice. Boarding the plane I realized my friend and I were going to have the very last seat in the plane; of course that's no surprise. I always get the back seat or the seat on the wing. There are three things wrong with getting the back seat. 1) You get a really bumpy ride; like riding in the back of a bus. 2) You are right next to the bathrooms so everyone goes in and out and in and out. 3) Actually I have never experienced number three until now; but I didn't like it. You are right in front of where the flight attendants sit; so you get to hear everything they say. These flight attendants were really loud and really whiney. They sat and talked about everyone on the whole plane; the customers and even the pilot and co-pilot; things I particularly did not want to hear. They acted like it was the end of the world when a passenger would call for them. Not only did the flight attendants have a bad attitude in secrecy; they were rude to the passengers. They acted like it would kill them to answer a simple question. Now I don't know; maybe I'm stupid, but I thought Flight Attendants were supposed to be friendly. My trip back was about the same; more whiney flight attendants; except this time I was closer to the front. We had a lay-over in chicago on the return trip. When we got back on the plane; only about ten people were on it going back to Columbus. There were whole rows for each person and nobody else was going to get on. Well guess what? On this incredibly empty plane with very few passengers, my friend and I were crowed into a seat with another passenger. The guy sat there and when he realized no one else was boarding he started to move. A flight attendant walked over and very rudely asked. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; The guy explained that there was no sense in us all sitting together and said he was moving. &quot;You can't do that.&quot; She spat back at him. So the guy gets a little angry and started to raise his voice. The flight attendant ran and got the pilot. Mind you, this guy was not rude, he was angry, but civil. The pilot asked what was going on and the guy explained. The pilot just laughed and let him move. The flight attendant was angry and of course when the pilot went up front to take off, she began talking about him. Surprise, surprise. So while this was on the same trip I flew on three different airplanes with three different crews and every flight was the same. While my flight itself on America West was not bad; I don't think I'll ever fly it again. I'll take Delta; at least on it you are appreciated."
398128;America West Airlines has, by far, the easiest web site there is for trip planning, booking flights, comparing fares and schedules. I had no trouble finding the date and time I wanted to travel. I had options to go non-stop or take a less expensive flight with a one hour layover. Flights leave Omaha for Las Vegas almost hourly. With rates always in the affordable range, I usually go to America West first when planning a trip. I have flown America West at least 20 times in the last 5 years. Only once did I encounter the slightest bit of confusion. At that particular time, the airline over booked. They were very generous with their consolation awards for those unable to take the flight, by offering $100.00 cash and a free ticket for future travel. I'll fly with America West when ever the airline provides transportation to my destination.
400993;Back in early spring I made reservations for my boyfriend and myself for Las Vegas. America West had the best price and pretty good connections ? we had to change planes at Phoenix, but the return flight was non-stop Las Vegas to Indianapolis. Needless to say, just one week after I booked these non-refundable tickets, the big news story was that America West was at the very bottom of customer satisfaction. I couldn?t cancel the reservations, so I just did a lot of worrying. Well, all the worry was for nothing. July 24, 2001, we flew to Las Vegas. From the moment we checked our luggage at Indy, I knew I didn?t have anything to worry about. Granted, from watching the Weather Channel, I knew we had smooth flying with no bad storms brewing, so at least there would be no weather delays. Everyone I encountered that was employed by America West was upbeat, cheerful and went out of his/her way to make my flight more pleasant. The gate agent at Indy announced we would have a hot meal between Indy and Phoenix, and there?d also be a ?chick flick? to watch. The Indy to Phoenix flight took off right on schedule. It was an Airbus A320 which carries 150 passengers and even in economy class, we had plenty of leg room. My friend is 6?1? and he could easily cross his legs. There was plenty of hip room in the seats also. Dinner was beef enchiladas, a salad and a package of M&M?s. It was even pretty tasty, for airline food. We had two beverage services. Cocktails are $4.00 and beer/wine are $3.00, other drinks are free. The movie was $5.00 for the headsets and was Heartbreakers, which starred Sigourney Weaver. Good movie too. The movie screens come out of the overhead compartments right over the middle seat, but they do not get in the way. Landed in Phoenix on time. Had a brief 40 minute layover. Next flight Phoenix to Vegas was on a Boeing 757, which holds 190 passengers. These had just as much leg room, but about 1 inch less hip room. My only complaint on this flight was they announced because of expected turbulence, there would be no beverage service. I think they just didn?t have enough time to serve all the passengers during a hour flight. There wasn?t much turbulence at all. Landed in Las Vegas EARLY. Let?s see how America West does on the way home. Red eye flight back to Indy, leaving 11:30 PM Las Vegas time. We arrive at the airport about an hour before flight time. Even though I have a rolling carryon, I get tired of carrying my luggage, so I always check it anyway. I couldn?t believe the line at the America West ticket counter. There was at LEAST 200 people waiting to check through and get their boarding passes. I thought ?no way?, a lady who works for America West was going through the line asking our destinations. For some reason, people who were going to New York and Columbus OH had their own special line, the rest of us had to wait in this line, but the lady said to trust her, the line moves quickly. I thought, yeah sure. Well, she was right, we had our boarding passes and luggage checked in less than 15 minutes. I can?t believe it, even the Las Vegas to Indianapolis non-stop flight left on time and arrived early in Indianapolis. It was also an Airbus A320, which has become my favorite aircraft. Even though it only has 2 engines, one on each wing, it has a tremendous amount of power as it takes off down the runway, and uses very little runway to lift off. Really a neat aircraft. America West has a great frequent flier program. It only takes 20,000 miles to get a free trip. I?m far from being a frequent flier (1 to 2 trips per year), but they have other ways to earn mileage. For one, just signing up gets you 3000 miles, and if you apply for their credit card, you get 6000. Also purchases at PetSmart, JC Penney and Walmart earn you credits. So it won?t take long for me to get a free trip. Also, in my opinion, people like to complain about the smallest little things. For instance, passengers who push those attendant call buttons for the most insignificant reasons. One woman sitting behind me on the return flight said she was going to file a complaint because when she pushed the attendant call button on her flight TO Vegas, the flight attendant wouldn't bring her another bottle of wine PRONTO. Come on now, wine isn't a necessity, and the flight attendants aren't waitresses. I don?t think America West deserves last place in the polls. I think America West has vastly improved since last year when the customer satisfaction survey was taken.
410247;"One aspect of travel that I would like to rest assured in assuming I can take as a &quot;given&quot; is the notion that making a reservation on a specific day will in fact guarantee my traveling on said day. Until a recent experience which proved to be nothing short of absolute rock-bottom, I had never felt so completely and utterly shafted by an organization or an individual, for that matter. I fly to Vegas from time to time on business, and I can say that I've been shuffled from flight to flight on occasion; I cheerily volunteer my ticket in exchange for vouchers now and then, in order to accomodate the overbooking policy, my feelings on which should be best saved for a separate exposition. On the date of the infamous event about which I am writing, Las Vegas was enjoying some terrific weather. On-time departure looked like a lock, and I was ready to get home to San Francisco. Apparently San Francisco was getting drizzled on, and there was (gasp!) some fog. No problem, a phone call confirmed an on-time departure, and I headed to McCarran International Airport. Upon arrival at the gate, a perky America West clerk informed me that the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and all other flights out of Las Vegas, on all other airlines, were overbooked. It took a moment to fully understand what she had just told me - that I was marooned in Vegas. I threw a minor fit, inquiring about the blood alcohol level of the decision maker, and was told that America West is the first to abandon flight plans in the event of nasty weather. I asked if they ever flew into Seattle, and didn't get an answer. After begrudgingly accepting the idea of missing work and laying by a pool for one more day, I asked where the best place would be to pick up a hotel voucher. What I wasn't expecting to hear was that hotel vouchers aren't dispensed on account of weather-related cancellations. What I wasn't expecting from the airline was to basically tell me in no uncertain terms that they don't care about a client's repeat business or the trashing of their reputation across a nation. I find it offensive that as an organization, they value their customers' time so little as to offer different options to each person who is inconvenienced (I witnessed this), fail to provide reimbursement for what is essentially a decision they made with no justification, and smile at you all the while. All in all I would not recommend this airline to anyone who expects to be treated fairly and arrive in the destination city on the date the reservation &quot;guarantees.&quot;"
410779;Recently, I paid a visit to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California. When I booked the trip, I had the option of flying into either Los Angeles, CA, or Las Vegas, NV. I chose Vegas because I&#146d never been there before, and it was only three hours away from Fort Irwin. Also, I&#146d already had enough of Northern Virginia traffic to trade it for its Southern California equivalent, and I needed a break. For those who haven&#146t traveled on the government&#146s dime, &#147lowest cost&#148 is the rule. Your plane reservations will be with the most economical airline that flies the most direct, uncomplicated route to and from your destination. Sometimes you luck out and get a good deal, sometimes not. This time I flew America West Airlines, and my experience was a 70/30 mix of good and bad. I&#146m chronically early, so I arrived at Washington Reagan National Airport nearly two hours before departure time. Usually, that much of a time gap is overkill. Quite often, I&#146m through the check-in portion in a matter of minutes and on my way to security. Not so with this airlines. America West&#146s Passenger Check-In Station was in desperate need of a makeover. Positioned in front of the counter was the typical &#147amusement park&#148 serpentine, already backed up into the corridor with passengers. To one side was a bank of E Ticket Check-In terminals that were barely being used. In the middle of it all was a lone, harried, ramp agent attempting to direct traffic. The problem: The E Ticket holders, who should have gone directly to the side terminals, were forced into the serpentine with everyone else. Instead of walking directly to a machine (rearranging the serpentine would have made this easier), they had to navigate the maze until called by one of the ramp agents and directed to a machine. This oversight wasted a lot of valuable time, and frustrated a lot of the customers. What should have taken ten minutes, instead took thirty. Sickened by this sight, but afraid that hesitation would cost me more time, I joined the chain gang of passengers making their way to the ramp agent. When I finally arrived at an open portal, I found that the actual process was quick and intuitive. If you haven&#146t used one of these automatic check-in stations before the process is fairly easy. You can either find your reservation by entering your confirmation number or by swiping a credit card. Don&#146t worry, you won&#146t be charged, the machine just reads your name off the card. Next, manually enter the first three letters of your destination. Your reservation will appear on the screen. Check your information and identify the number of bags you are checking in. Once that&#146s complete, you&#146ll get a printed boarding pass. You take that and your bag to a representative at the counter who will verify your identify and check your bags. Once I got to a machine, the process took about five minutes. Things continued to improve. The ramp agents at the gate were professional, calm, and very much in charge. We boarded the plane by groups, and I noticed that a couple of passengers were turned away when they attempted to jump ahead of the line. On board the aircraft, the flight attendants were clean, courteous, and very efficient. Everyone was seated, doors closed and we pulled away from the gate five minutes early. In-flight service was terrific. We flew an Airbus 319 to Las Vegas, and it&#146s a very nice airplane. Although I was forced into a middle seat (remember that &#147government&#148 thing) it wasn&#146t so bad. I still had plenty of leg room. There were ample lavatories, and a large amount of overhead bin space. This trip was over four hours long, so America West offers in-flight entertainment that consists of a feature-length movie, some short documentaries, and a sitcom. They offer proprietary headsets for $5.00 if anyone is interested. Also, there is a meal service for nominal cost ($5.00 for a sandwich, or $2.00 for a muffin or cookie). I already had breakfast so I skipped the meal. Everyone got an entire can of soda or juice as well, and the flight attendants made multiple rounds throughout the flight to make sure everyone had enough to drink. The remaining time in the air was uneventful, and we arrived in Las Vegas about fifteen minutes early. I had no outstanding issues with baggage claim, which was fast, and efficient. Leaving Las Vegas was just like leaving Washington National, only worse. The America West Passenger Check-In Station in Las Vegas was larger than the one in DC, but the same arrangement issues prevailed. E-Ticket machines were stowed neatly out of the way, while passengers flailed about looking for the correct line to stand in. I had to track down an agent just to discover that I was in the wrong spot. The addition of intelligent signage and repositioning of lines and machines would alleviate a lot of their passenger throughput problems. Once we were airborne, things operated like they did on my outbound trip. I flew back on a Boeing 757, which was a very spacious and comfortable aircraft. I lucked out and got an aisle seat this time. Similar to the ride out to Las Vegas, America West offered a full in- flight entertainment program, as well as a meal service. This time I was hungry, so I tried the Rustic Cheeseburger, which consisted of a quarter pound of beef with cheese on a hard roll. It was hot and very satisfying. I slept the rest of the way home and arrived on time back in DC. As before, there were no issues with bags. Although my experience with this airline is limited, I did notice some obvious trends. Service was poor on the ground, and great in the air. The ramp agents were by majority stressed, impatient, and disorganized, while the flight crews were calm, organized, and attentive. It causes me to wonder if America West Airlines knows of this disparity and if so, whether or not they are working to correct it, or if it even matters. Overall, I&#146d fly America West again. Their aircraft were clean, the food was good and the crew was pleasant. Although I didn&#146t pay for this trip, I&#146ve checked their fares on the web and find them to be reasonable, at least with regard to onboard service. I think you might agree with me. But be sure to allow for ample check-in time.
413786;It is a good idea to sign up for all the email alerts on last minute fares. The best deals I've seen are through Icelandair: www.icelandair.com and America West: www.americawest.com. I saw America West's great deal to Orange County, CA on one of their best fares email alerts. I called my friend in Newport Beach to tell her I was on my way -only to find that not every flight on Friday night outgoing, nor Monday night incoming flight was available at the special rate. Weekend deals may only allow you to leave on Saturday and return on Monday, so 9 to 5'ers are out of the running. The deals are based on E-tickets, which can have drawbacks, your travel information may not be in the airline's computer in which case you have no recourse. A passenger with a paper ticket has proof positive in their hand that their flight was booked, it's true their booking may not be in the computer either, but if you are in a non-English speaking country, or are dealing with an airline strike or bankruptcy, a traditional ticket may be your real ticket home. If you're changing planes several times or going far afield, play it safe, get a paper ticket, but for short hops the email alert deals are the best way to fly
423417;"Like everyone else, I was looking for a &quot;bargain&quot; flight to Cabo San Lucas from LA. Well, I found one, or thought I did, with America West. Believe it or not we had to fly from LAX to Phoenix then to Cabo. As the hub for America West is in Phoenix, I guess it was too surprising. It did save us about $40 each way in our fare, but in the long run it was not worth it. We arrived in Cabo on time and ok, however my luggage and several other passengers luggage did not. I found the ground crew in Cabo to be quit friendly and helpful in spite of the language barrier. They informed me that they would call my resort in the afternoon to let me know where the luggage was. We went to he resort and waited, no phone call. The next morning I phoned the airport and was told the luggage was directed to Mazatlan and would arrive back in Cabo this afternoon. Well, I was relieved to learn that my luggage had at least been found. One of the other passengers who's luggage was lost, happened to be staying in our hotel. Her luggage was never found, they found the baggage claim checks on someone else's luggage! To make a long story short, by luggage did not arrive for 3 days, because they kept &quot;forgetting&quot; to put it on the plane in Mazatlan. I was told to buy some clothes and they would reimburse me, so I purchased some shorts and t-shirts in Cabo. On the return trip, our flight from Cabo was delayed 3 hours and then finally cancelled. As we had to be at work the next day, my friend and I really started to get concerned as the only other airline out of Cabo is Mexicana. American West finally put us on Mexicana, first class, straight into LAX. That was the nicest thing they could have done. We actually arrived an hour earlier than we would have with American West. It took them 3 months to reimburse me for my expenses. There customer service is the worst I have ever experienced in the airline world."
424798;"Our trip was planned several months in advance so it wasn't as if my husband and I were flying standby to Hartford, CT from Los Angeles one week before the Labor Day Weekend. We wanted to avoid the major airline traffic and overbookings that occur over holiday weekends. America West tickets were obtained over the Internet and confirmation was also received via snail mail. Acting as my own travel agent, I figured how much worse could the service be for a couple hundred dollars less? I chose America West because it offered the least expensive flights for the dates I wanted connecting to the places I wanted since I didn't want to pay full price for a direct flight. I was willing to have one stop-over but not three or four! The trouble started when we arrived the designated one hour in advance of departure. Even though we were a little early, we waited for one hour and the line for check-in, did not move. About fifteen minutes before actual departure time, a woman rushed out of a service door, yelled out some number that was not our flight and tried to get people to rush up to the counter. Finally, I ascertained that she was talking about our departure time and we headed for the counter. I told her that we would have understood more easily if she said &quot;Flight #----&quot; or &quot;Departure time:--:--.&quot; She replied that if we didn't rush, we would miss our flight. I commented that many other people in line were on our flight and that the plane couldn't leave without the passengers...could it? The check-in delay was never explained. All other employees seemed extremely laid back and weren't rushing to do anything. When we reached the boarding area, there was sheer chaos. I snapped at my husband that for a couple hundred more dollars, we could receive real bonafide service. Other people inline were in agreement. From flying previously on America West, I knew to bring my own food. The reason being that only a snack bag could be expected. Even though I specify dietary restrictions (sugar and wheat allergies), the airlines (not only America West) can rarely grasp the meaning of this. I have received all sorts of weird meals but only snacks which were not edible by me from America West. People usually express delight at the scent of my delicious, home cooked meal and wish they had done the same. This flight was no different. We arrived in Phoenix in one piece and made our connecting flight without incident. In spite of the delay leaving Los Angeles (after the threat of missing our flight), we departed Phoenix for Hartford. We enjoyed our further travel plans in New England and returned to Hartford thirteen days later to fly home. Upon entering the airport in Hartford, we were told apologetically by America West's newest employee that our flight had been delayed by two plus hours! The flight crew had to sleep according to federal law. I felt optimistic knowing that our crew would be refreshed and ready to roll whenever they finished sleeping. Safety first, I thought! My husband wasn't so pleased. Our connecting flight was to be missed in Las Vegas, so, America West, not being able to reach us (because we were on the road without a cell phone), rebooked our flight. In their infinite wisdom, they thought we would want to stay in Hartford without a hotel and by this time it was after ten o'clock at night. We would fly the following morning at 6 a.m. and connect at some time later in the day in Las Vegas. We insisted that we couldn't wait to fly, with two cats at home, waiting to be fed in the morning. We would have to make other arrangements and we flew that night. We waited in Las Vegas for the next flight to Los Angeles. The problem was that we had to claim our baggage and carry it around with us because our next flight was more than four hours later. We were refused a lounge area to sleep in due to the long lay-over. I believe it was because the supervisor just didn't want to make the effort to open a room for us. Finally we arrived in Los Angeles at 8 a.m., extremely disheveled and exhausted as you must be after reading all of this. Here's my advice in short: Take short trips on America West. Bring your own meal. Be prepared to be delayed, in other words, don't make tight travel plans that fit together like a puzzle. If you don't want to pay full fee, remember nothing comes free. And you can't get peanuts anymore, either!!"
425055;We chose to fly on America West during our last trip from Orlando to Las Vegas. Why? Well they have a non-stop flight as instead of connections and they fly red eye service both in and out of Vegas. There isn't any food service. They snack they serve with beverages is a bag of peanuts or something equally non existant. Soft drinks were provided with the entire can including a cup. The coffee was weak. The movie didn't work on the outbound flight. However, blankets and pillows were on each chair when we boarded and they left and arrived either on time or early and they beat Delta's price about $100.00 per person. Would I fly them again? Yes, price and scheduling are very important and I would just pack a heavier snack.
426543;"I recently travelled to Idaho on America West Airlines. I was sure that I would have no problem because I was leaving at 7:00 AM and taking a &quot;Red Eye&quot; home. On the contrary, when I got to the airport the recommended 1 hour before flight time, there was a line of about 30 people and no one at the counter. You see, they had not yet gotten to work. When I got to my gate, the flight had been delayed for 45 minutes. Upon asking why this was, I was told it was in order to space out flights. WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE THE DEPARTURE TIME LATER THEN??? POINT #1: America West has terrible counter service. Upon our descent into Phoenix, we were told that we would be arriving 1 hour late. The problem was that my connection was exactly 1 hour after the original arrival time. When I asked the Flight Attendant if they could contact the gate to let them know we were in fact coming or if they could ask those not connecting to stay on the plane so that all those who were could get off first he snapped &quot;I have nothing to do with the people at the aiport. They know you're coming&quot;. POINT #2: America West has the most unprofessional flight attendants I have EVER seen. When we arrived in Phoenix, we found that our flight was delayed again because it was overbooked by 12 people! POINT #3: Arrive early to make sure you get your seat. AW overbooks their flights and will give your seat away if you are not checked in 20 minutes prior to the flight. On my return trip, our flight attendants made jokes of the safety manual and the drills they run pre-flight. They joked and laughed. Passengers were picking up the intercom speaking prior to our flight. POINT #2 (AGAIN): America West has extremely unprofessional flight attendants. All in all, I would say that America West Airlines is below satisfactory. I did not feel safe because the Flight Staff was unprofessional and rude. I also found it difficult to find out information about my connecting flights and seating. The flights are often overbooked and people's seats are separated without reason or approval. The only reason I travelled this airline was that I got a low fare on LOWESTFARE.COM -- if it had not saved me $750 I would not have chosen this airline. If you should travel with them, make sure you show up early and that you leave time in between connections just to be safe. I will not be travelling this Airline again under any circumstances."
427341;"I just recently got home from Las Vegas. Believe it or not, being 32 almost 33 years old, this was my very first time flying. I was excited about the trip and since I had never flown before I decided to get to the airport 2 hours early, to allow myself enough time for everything with no worries. As soon as I stepped up to get my boarding pass I was told there was a 2 hour delay, ugh! They did offer to send me on another flight that left in a few minutes but my friends didn't want to do that and we waited it out patiently. We killed a hour sitting down for dinner to find out our flight had another hour tacked onto the already 2 hour delay. So far I am not liking my first experience with traveling! 4 different times I stopped to ask a America West employee a question and 3 of those times was spoken to rudely and treated with disrespect. I could not seem to get a straight answer as to why our flight was delayed or when we would actually be leaving. I had explained I had never flown before and wasn't sure which gate we were supposed to be at, and was answered in a rude tone and told the WRONG gate, not once, but twice! Our flight all in all ended up being delayed 3 1/2 hours, and I found the gate on my own with the luck of only a rabbit's foot in my pocket is all I can figure. While sitting at the airport wondering if I was left for a slow and painful death, I looked around and noticed everyone seemed as miserable as I was, and the few people I spoke to were just as confused on our actual departure time as I was. Finally, out of sheer boredom and to break the gloom and doom mood among us all, I spoke up and said, &quot;Since we can't get to Vegas to gamble, let's bring Vegas to us&quot;. With that I had a crowd's attention and I began asking if anyone would like to place a $10 bet on when we would actually depart, jokingly of course, but it really broke the mood and people began yelling out times that they wanted to place their bet on. Once on the plane we were fortunate enough to have a small amount of people on the plane so we were told we could sit where we wanted to. We chose to take a row with no one else in it and laid down to get some sleep. We had a midnight flight so sleeping sure sounded like the best thing about this trip so far. The stewardess's were somewhat helpful but not as friendly as I expected. I had trouble with the buttons that controlled the stations you could listen to over your headsets, they would stop playing and you would have to switch channels and go back. The flight home was on time luckily and was a semi pleasant experience. Since this was my first time flying I think my next trip I will try another airline and see if I like it better, I really wasn't very impressed with the attitude of the America West staff. Sure, I had one friendly person,but I expect friendly service from all the staff. If you have been happy with another airline in the past, I would suggest sticking with them. *NOTE* incase you are wondering, the flight did not come with a meal, only peanuts and I was given a free soft drink. My ticket which was purchased through AAA was $205 for a round trip ticket from Ohio to Las Vegas, including tax."
429386;I last flew America West from Reagan National Airport in Washington to Phoenix in September. As this was a Priceline ticket, I could not expect anything but my seat in steerage, but I did note that their rules for upgrading had been tightened along with most of the rest of the industry. Check-In, Washington The line at the counter was not too long, but this was in the waning days of pre-9-11 air travel. In just one and a half weeks, air travel would be changed forever..... The staff at the counter were pleasant and efficient, without being over-familiar. I was soon on my way to the gate. Washington-Columbus This flight took about an hour and was uneventful. I was served juice, coffee and a bun. Fortunately, the plane was only about 1/3 full. The aircraft on this segment was a smaller plane, perhaps a Fokker 130, a large propeller plane. Columbus-Phoenix This was on a larger Boeing 757, absolutely jammed from end to end with holiday trippers. The couple next to me were off to the Excalibur in Las Vegas. I hope they liked children, as the Excalibur. is little more than an enormous playpen with a casino... The food on this flight was somewhat more extensive, a salad with strips of grilled chicken and sesame dressing being on offer. It was nearly flavorless, but was, at least, edible. Movie The first part of the movie program was The Princess Diaries , a movie I had been subjected to on other flights as well. I was glad I had brought a book. The latter portion of the video presentation appeared to consist of music videos. The Return my return flight was much the same, except that I did not have to change planes anywhere. The movie was just as bad, something involving Eddie Murphy and animals, an unhappy combination. Another big plus was that all of the flights were on time. In fact, we landed early on two out of three flight segments. First Class While this flight was not in First Class, I have flown with them in first before. The seats are indeed larger, and the food is modestly better. It is served on lilen and china, or once was. I would only recommend it if you can find some way of upgrading your ticket, as their fares are high in the front cabin. Service The staff on the ground and in the air were competent and businesslike, without exuding any particular warmth. I had no complaints, really. I left a blazer on board the plane and did not remember I had left it there until I was almost to the baggage claim area. Of course, upon my return to the gate, it was nowhere to be found. I had to go an fill out a report. I have heard nothing from them. Baggage No problems with baggage at all. My bags arrived unscathed and at the right airports. Cost I have often found that America West pops up as the airline I will take when booking through Priceline. I suppose they must have large blocks of seats sold out to them. On other occasions, I have also found that America West had the lowest fares on offer. Overall This is not a bad airline, certainly not among the worst. it is not an outstanding airline either. Given their precarious financial picture, I suppose we should be grateful that they are flying at all.
430980;"Wow I can confidently say that the first time I took America West will certainly be the last. I scoured the internet looking for a good package for a weekend to Las Vegas. Being a student means we don't have a lot of money so when I found an excellent deal of 4 nights at the Aladdin Hotel and round trip airfare at 365.00 per person I couldn't enter my credit card number fast enough. What goes to show you get what you pay for, my cheap trip turned into a major nightmare. The Flight Las Vegas My fiancee and I arrived an hour early for our flight. While I don't believe in bad omens I really should sart. At the check-in counter we were ignored for about 10 min while the clerks chatted and kept their heads down. No ""I'll be with you in a minute"" no nothing. When we were finally acknowledged the first words out of the clerks mouth was ""We are offering $300.00 credit to give up your seat."" First of all, why do they think people get 7:30 flights to begin with? Because people want to start their vacations EARLY thats why. Who wants to wait three hours for another flight when its not even for sure you'll get on it. Thanks but I'll have to pass on that one. I refused and snatched up our boarding passes. The flight went relatively smooth, the highlight is that the flight attendents were really nice. We were served drinks and mini pretzels. Needless to say I was happy to finally get out of the McCarran America West Terminal. The Return Flight to San Fran After returning the rental car we arrived three hours before our return flight home. Hoping to get another flight to the bay area, I called the America West hotline while standing in line. I was told that getting another flight shouldn't be a problem all I had to do was discuss it with the ticket clerk. The clerk told a different story. First he said it would be an additional two hundred dollars and we would be placed on standby. Well ok, that wasn't going to work I decided to stick with our original flight. Looking at our tickets and the tv screen were were told to go to gate B6. There was also a possible weather delay. No prob we could wait. Well thirty minutes before our flight was to leave no one else was at the gate. Not only that, but the screen said B20 was where the gate was supossed to be. No announcement no nothing. We arrived at gate B20 to find a fair amount of people and a ticket agent saying we were going to be delayed. Wow big suprise. The thing is we asked to be put on a different airline and we would pay the difference only to be told we have a go time so we aren't authorized to do that. The go time was three hours later at 9:30pm. We stood up got in line and then were told sorry we can't fly to San Francisco just yet. We have a go time of 10:30. Needless to say people were totally mad including us. No one had any answers, no one was kind or patient. We finally boarded at 10:45 and sat on the plane for an HOUR! The attendant got on and gave a sob story of weather and the captain needing a form, blah blah blah. They passed out mini bottles of water and pillows and blankets. Someone was caught smoking in the back and most of the people near the exits couldn't speak clear English. This held us up with flying out since they had to be replaced with people who could read and speak English. We finally landed in San Francisco at 1:00am to clear night skys and 54 degrees. My warning about America West: Read the fine print on your tickets. A lot of the tickets say their flights have a 50% chance of being delayed. Demand answers and to be compensated if you feel they are jerking you around. Always be aware of the gate your flight is supossedly going out of. Chances are there is more than meets the eye."
431526;I flew America West round trip on a one stop flight. There was nothing either terrible or spectacular about them upon check in. The agents told me that although I had a confirmed e-ticket reservation, I'd have to wait to be called before receiving my boarding pass, because it was looking to be an overbooked flight. Although I was there early, I got my pass later on, and wound up in the back of the plane. Overall it didn't bother me though. Seating was cramped, but that was to be expected. What did bother me about the initial flight was that there was no audio on any of the segments I was on, although there was what appeared to be a small television monitor behind each seat. It was never used though. It was very strange indeed. The thing that bothered me most was that despite being among the first in line on the return flight, I was unable to sit with my girlfriend. This happened with a number of others on the same flight, and before we took off, everyone was trading seats with everyone else. Really though, it was a minor inconvenience at best. The attendants were nice, and the flight was smooth.
442856;America West is the worst airline ever. My scout troop and I saved for 2 years to visit the Florida Sea Base in Key West, Fla. We were going to take thier Bahamas Adventure tour, 7 days of sailing in the Bahamas. In order to let as many kids go as possible, we went for the cheap airline, America West. We arrived an hour early at LAX for our flight, and we had to stop over in Vegas to change planes. Our flight into Vegas got delayed due to a lightining storm, but we knew that wasn't the airlines fault. We left LAX three hours late, and when we arrived in Vegas, our connector to Miami had already left. They did'nt have anymore flights to Miami for 2 days, so they were gonna fly us back to LAX, and direct to Miami. But a flight to LAX was not available till 6:00am. So we spent that Midngiht until 6am Friday in the Vegas airport, they wouldn't get us a hotel room. So they flew us back to LAX, where we had to move to the other side of the airport to get a direct flight on American Airlines, which they paid for. I have no complaints about American, their service was excellent. When we got to Miami, we had missed our connector to the Abacos Islands in the Bahamas. There were no flights to that island again until Sunday, so we had to stay 2 nights in a hotel in Miami, WHICH AMERICA WEST HAS NOT REIMBURSED US FOR. So, when we finally got to the Bahamas we were 2 days late and still had to pay for the days of sailing we missed. I hope that America West goes out of business. Now answer the question: DO BOY SCOUTS DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS?
444182;I recently completed two round-trips on America West Airlines between SJC-PHX. On the whole, I was very impressed by every aspect of their operation. WEBSITE: We booked our tickets through their website (www.americawest.com), which turned out to be something of a boon, as America West was offering 3000 bonus miles for all tickets purchased online. The website has a comprehensive menu bar, as well as a search feature. The flight status and flight search features are accessible through the homepage, as they should be. Also featured on the homepage is a list of current fare specials and promotions. FARES: America West is a self-proclaimed low fare leader and at least at the times I flew, America West did indeed have the lowest fares on my route. Additionally, America West has recently relaxed some of its pricing policies, offering lower unrestricted fares and eliminating the Saturday night stay requirement on many tickets. However, they have not done away with the $100 ticket change fee, which undoubtedly must be a great source of revenue. CHECK-IN: Lines were negligible at SJC and PHX both times we flew. The customer service agents were friendly and efficient. America West has installed ATM-style check-in machines at a number of airports, and based on my one experience, they are very user-friendly. THE FLIGHTS: All four flights were on-time, which certainly came as a pleasant surprise. The aircraft (A320s and A319s) were clean and seats were comfortable. Legroom was adequate but not exceptional. On each flight, in-flight service consisted of drinks and snack mix. Nothing out of the ordinary here, although I did notice that America West offers a larger selection of beer and wine than some airlines (albeit, not complimentary). BAGGAGE: Baggage delivery was prompt every time. At PHX, I appreciated the announcements informing passengers of which carrousel their bags would be arriving upon. Why isn't this done at more airports?
446855;"America West taught me the hard way that saving $20 on a flight is NOT WORTH IT. I have flown America West three times. During this time period (before I swore off America West come Hell or high water), I also booked my best friend on a flight in exchange for his driving cross-country with me, and my sister booked a ticket to come visit me. My flights Each of my flights, despite not beginning or ending anywhere near this far West, connected in Las Vegas. Each of my flights, despite not beginning or ending anywhere near this far West, managed to get stranded overnight in perfectly clear summer weather in Las Vegas. Each time I was stranded overnight in Las Vegas, passengers were told each hour that it would be a short while later for us to take off. Right. Ten hours is more than &#147soon.&#148 I could have driven from Vegas to my destination, and back, and almost back AGAIN in this time. Each time the reason for the delay was &#147lost paperwork&#148 in Phoenix. I kid you not. I am a very patient person when it comes to these kinds of malfunctions. I even got to know the bookstore and got through two Wally Lamb novels on those oh-so-uncomfy airport floors. But 0-3 is a bit much! Thankfully I had no luggage lost on any of the three flights and no dying relatives I was trying to get back to. My friend&#146s flight Even if you still choose to fly America West for yourself, don&#146t ever purchase a ticket on this airline for someone else unless you are REALLY good friends and they are VERY forgiving. As a thank you, I purchased a one-way on America West for my best friend to visit his fianc after driving me to my new home on the opposite side of the country. Because of their schedules, the trip as it was would only be 2.5 days. Thanks to America West, which AGAIN lost paperwork in Phoenix (I had never mentioned this to him), he was stranded (this time in Phoenix itself, which again was West of both the origination and destination points) all day. This dampened the trip considerably for him. My sister&#146s flight My sister had booked a ticket on America West because it was cheap and she was on a college budget. I warned her about the delays I experienced and she said she wouldn&#146t mind, and was only bringing carry-on so they couldn&#146t lose her luggage. Well, she then got sick two days before the flight and called to cancel. First they told her she had to forfeit her ticket outright. I called again on her behalf and they said they&#146d change the ticket for a $100 change fee. $100! And it had to be used (not booked, but actually used) in the next three months, which was logistically impossible for her because of school. She could not transfer the ticket to someone else, either, so she essentially lost the $300 she had spent on the ticket. In sum Fly another airline. Like <a href=""/content_130070187652"">JetBlue</a>!"
447219;Why I Chose America West: I purchased a ticket to Denver, Colorado on America West for one reason: It was cheap! By flying America West to Denver, I saved $600.00. This was my first time flying with America West Airlines. The Planes: I flew on their deHavilland Dash-8. It held about 38 people. It was very loud. I also flew on their Boeing 737, which was in very good shape. Their planes were clean. I liked that you could listen to music on their flight with their music programming system. I was surprised they offered in since it was a shorter flight. My Experience: I flew from Palm Springs to Phoenix. My flight to Denver out of Phoenix left on time, and we even arrived early. It was problem-free. Check-in was no problem at all. On my flight back, there were problems. My flight back to Palm Springs was canceled because the flight attendants who were due to work on that flight had twisted their ankles and couldn't walk. Because of that, our flight was canceled. I found it unbelievable that they America West was unable to find a backup crew to do this flight. When they finally got me onto another flight, they told me that my luggage was lost and that nobody could find it. They ended up not being able to find my luggage for a whole week. When they finally did find it, they delivered it to my house at midnight! Customer Service: I think their customer service quality really varies. In Palm Springs, they were pretty nice. In Phoenix, they were anything but helpful. In Denver, some were helpful, and some were just plain rude. Their customer service phone people also differs. One woman that I spoke to was very friendly when she explained why I could not receive mileage, another was very unfriendly about it. Mileage Program: At the time, America West was offering a 2500 mileage bonus for new members upon completion of their first flight. They were also offering bonus miles for flights flown from Denver to Phoenix. I should have been able to have about 5,000 miles after my trip was done, but I was unable to get the miles. America West also will not give you miles for their FlightFund program if you book through some online ticket vendors, CheapTickets in my case. For instance, I bought a ticket online, and I was told that I could not receive mileage credit for it because it was bought at a discount price. I found this unusual considering they asked me for my FlightFund card at the airport and told me that I could check my mileage account at any time by calling a toll-free number.
456991;I wanted to go visit my Dad in Las Vegas and leave from Denver. I looked around and the only reasonable airfare was with America West airlines, it was cheaper by several hundred dollars! This is an important part of travel for me because I am in college and can't afford to spend more than a couple hundred bucks. My departing flight from Denver was delayed an hour and a half, but my departing flight from Vegas was on time. The departure times were really late at night making it a little inconvenient for me and the people who drove me to the airport! However, for such a reasonable fare I would fly America West again and brave the red-eye flights.
460356;"America West is a fairly inexpensive flight option between BWI and most cities out west, and there's a good reason for that. Booking a flight on America West is a gamble on a good day, and an outright travel disaster on a bad day. Of the 6-10 flights I've taken on America West, only one has left the gate on time. Only half empty flights aren't overbooked. If you travel on a weekend or a holiday, you will witness America West's overbooking in all of its glory. Gate attendants for America West at BWI are routinely surly and difficult to deal with. When we missed one flight due to DC traffic which delayed us three hours longer than expected, we were sent to the gate of the next flight out, which looked like it might have a few empty seats. After waiting in line for twenty minutes, I asked the gate attendant if there was availability on the next flight. She took my tickets for the previous flight, gave me a dirty look, ignoring my question, and tersely said, &quot;Go sit down and I'll call you later.&quot; I said, &quot;I just need to know if it looks like there will be any availability.&quot; She raised her voice, &quot;MA'AM I said go sit down and I will call you LATER!&quot; My boyfriend and I, duly and rudely chastised, took a seat. While I went to get us a drink the gate attendant pointed at Jon and called him over. When he arrived she said, &quot;Go get your woman.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have availability for the both of us?&quot; She said, &quot;JUST go get your woman!&quot; When he found me I showed up and she handed me tickets for Jon and myself. I knew better than to inquire about why she needed for me to be present to pick up both of our tickets. I did however, ask, &quot;Don't you need to see our ID's?&quot; She said, &quot;No just go board the flight.&quot; That's right, Jon and I boarded a cross-country flight from BWI on America West without having to show any identification to get our new tickets. A violation of FAA regulations, and a very dangerous one at that. Due to delays, our flights which were supposed to arrive in Phoenix, Arizona at midnight, didn't get us there until 3AM. A small packet of pretzel mix and a single cup of soda was all we were offered to eat on the 5 hour flight there and back, leaving us famished in Phoenix at 3am with few options for eating. When I called America West to complain, the customer service representative was very nice and seemed to care. She even sent us a couple of vouchers for heavily discounted future flights. But I've come to the realization that certain experiences aren't worth enduring for a second time, no matter how good the price is."
462257;My wife and I have taken America West for several trips recently, once roundtrip from Boston to San Francisco and then from Boston to Las Vegas. The only problems we had with America West is that they kept having some sort of problems, hydraulic problems usually. That's one of those problems you're kind of glad that they indeed caught and postponed flying you on. But inconvenient nonetheless. But it actually worked out for us in that we were bumped to a direct flight on United and got to our destination an hour before we were scheduled too. The flying experience itself was fine. I am pretty tall, and I don't quite fit into the seats, but not any worse than any other planes. They don't really serve any meals, just snacks, but since they rarely have a cross-country direct flight, you're not in the air all that long.
